An **ETC** is an **Exchange-Traded Commodity**—a stock-exchange-listed product that gives you exposure to a commodity (like gold, silver, oil) or a commodity index. In Europe, ETCs are **not funds**; they’re typically **debt securities (notes/certificates)** issued by a company and designed to track the commodity’s price.

How they’re built (and why it matters):

- **Structure:** Most commodity ETCs are issued as **secured, limited-recourse notes**, often backed by collateral such as **allocated physical metal** held with a custodian (for gold ETCs). That backing reduces—but does not eliminate—**issuer/credit risk** because they’re still debt instruments.

- **Why not an ETF?** In the EU, ETFs are generally UCITS funds and face **diversification/eligibility rules** that limit pure single-commodity exposure, so providers use ETCs instead.

- **Trading:** ETCs trade intraday like shares and other ETPs on exchanges (London, Xetra, etc.). ([London Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/raise-finance/etps/etcs-and-etns?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ETCs and ETNs"))
    

Example: **iShares Physical Gold ETC (SGLN)** explicitly states it’s **not an ETF** but a series of **secured metal-linked debt securities**; the gold bars follow **LBMA Good Delivery** standards.

Bottom line: If you want direct commodity exposure in Europe (e.g., gold in Trade Republic), you’ll usually be buying a **commodity ETC**—a listed **note** that tracks the metal’s price, often physically backed, with **issuer risk** distinct from a UCITS ETF.
