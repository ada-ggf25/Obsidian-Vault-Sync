## Summary

Quantitative equity strategies typically use a proxy for the risk-free rate drawn from U.S. government debt when calculating performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio). The most common proxy is the three-month Treasury bill yield, which as of May 2025 stands at approximately **4.27%**, closely tracking its long-run average of **4.20%** [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/3_month_t_bill?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Alternative short-term proxies include the effective federal funds rate, which averaged **4.61%** from 1954–2025 and was **4.33%** in April 2025 [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/effective-federal-funds-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/effective_federal_funds_rate_monthly?utm_source=chatgpt.com). For longer-horizon benchmarking, quants sometimes use the ten-year Treasury yield, which currently hovers around **4.43%** versus a long-term mean of **4.25%** [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_treasury_rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Historically, across the full 1928–2024 dataset, three-month T-bill yields averaged about **3.98%** [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/286/3-month-treasury-bill-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Common Risk-Free Proxies in Quant Strategies

### 1. Three-Month Treasury Bill Yield

The standard choice for U.S. equity quant backtests is the yield on three-month Treasury bills, reflecting a nearly risk-free short-term instrument. Industry references (e.g., Investopedia) note that “U.S. Treasury bill yields” are often used as the risk-free rate in Sharpe ratio and CAPM calculations [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Quant practitioners may also use a similar measure from the Daily Treasury Yield Curve (H.15) data [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?field_tdr_date_value=2025&type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### 2. Effective Federal Funds Rate

Some strategies employ the Fed funds effective rate, representing the overnight borrowing cost between depository institutions. As of May 15, 2025, this rate was **4.33%** (daily data), compared to its long-term average of **4.61%** [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/effective-federal-funds-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The New York Fed defines the EFFR as a volume-weighted median of overnight transactions [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### 3. Ten-Year Treasury Yield

For more strategic or multi-year backtests, some quants choose the ten-year Treasury constant maturity rate. Currently around **4.43%**, this yield sits close to its 54-year average of **4.25%** [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_treasury_rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Practical Backtesting Considerations

- **Dynamic vs. Static Assumptions**
    
    Many quants pull historical daily or monthly risk-free rates directly (e.g., from FRED’s H.15 release) to match the backtest period dynamically [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?field_tdr_date_value=2025&type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Annualization**
    
    Daily or monthly risk-free rates are annualized (e.g., multiplying daily rates by 252 trading days) when computing metrics like the Sharpe ratio [QuantInsti Blog](https://blog.quantinsti.com/sharpe-ratio-applications-algorithmic-trading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Choice of Tenor**
    
    Shorter tenors (overnight Fed funds, 1-month or 3-month T-bills) are preferred for high-frequency strategies, while longer tenors (1-year or 10-year Treasuries) may be used for longer-horizon strategies.
    
- **Yield Environment Impact**
    
    The prevailing interest-rate environment can materially affect risk-adjusted performance metrics; during periods of very low rates, Sharpe ratios tend to be inflated, and vice versa during high-rate regimes [Quantitative Finance Stack Exchange](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/28385/what-value-should-the-risk-free-monthly-return-rate-be-sharpe-ratio-calculation?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

In practice, most equity quants default to the **3-month Treasury bill yield**, which currently is near **4.3%** per annum and hovers around its multi-decade mean of **4.2%**, making it the de facto risk-free rate for backtesting U.S. stock strategies.
