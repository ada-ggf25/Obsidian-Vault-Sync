# Historical Sports Betting Odds Datasets for LSTM Modeling

Several publicly accessible datasets offer rich **historical sports betting odds** with match outcomes, suitable for training sequence models like LSTMs. Below are some notable datasets meeting the criteria (time-series odds, final results, high volume), focusing on sports with low draw rates and data from reputable bookmakers/exchanges. Each dataset entry includes its coverage, the frequency of odds updates, available fields, volume, source, and format.

## 1. _Beat The Bookie_ – Worldwide Football (Soccer) Odds Dataset (Kaggle)

- **Coverage**: Global football (soccer) matches from 2005–2016, spanning 1000+ leagues. It contains over **500,000 matches** with odds from up to 32 bookmakers[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=10%20year%20historical%20closing%20odds%3A)[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=14). (Matches from 2005–2015 include closing odds; a subset of ~92k matches in 2015–2016 has detailed time-series odds.)
- **Odds Updates**: Provides **hourly odds snapshots** for the last 72 hours before each match start in the 2015–2016 subset[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=14). For the full 10-year span, it includes each bookie’s **closing odds** at kickoff[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=10%20year%20historical%20closing%20odds%3A). This captures how odds move over time (hourly) leading up to matches, as well as the final odds.
- **Data Fields**: Each entry contains match details (date/time, league, teams), the final score/outcome, and odds from numerous bookmakers at various timestamps[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=,start%20of%20the%20match)[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=,1005%20leagues%20around%20the%20world). For time-series data, odds are recorded at consistent intervals (hourly) from opening to close; for long-term data, it includes aggregated metrics like maximum and average closing odds across bookies[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=10%20year%20historical%20closing%20odds%3A). Final results are clearly indicated (full-time scores, winners/draw).
- **Source & Format**: The dataset was released by researchers of a peer-reviewed study on beating bookmakers[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=strategy%20to%20beat%20football%20bookmakers,with%20their%20own%20numbers). It was **assembled via extensive web scraping** of odds comparison sites (e.g. OddsPortal/Betbrain) and is **available on Kaggle** as a collection of CSV files (with an SQL database dump also provided)[payititi.com](https://www.payititi.com/opendatasets/show-11169.html#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20make%20the%20full,for%20our%20study%20on%20github). The data is free to download and is considered credible, given its origin from an academic project and inclusion of well-known bookmakers’ odds.

## 2. **ATP & WTA Tennis Matches Odds (2000–2019)** – Kaggle Dataset

- **Coverage**: Professional **tennis matches** on the ATP (men’s) and WTA (women’s) tours from **2000 up to 2019**[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakeem/atp-and-wta-tennis-data/data#:~:text=ATP%20and%20WTA%20matches%20results,2000%2C%20including%20Grand%20Slams%2C). This nearly two-decade span includes thousands of matches each year (Grand Slams, tour finals, and regular tour events), totaling tens of thousands of match records. Each match entry includes the result and pre-match odds.
- **Odds Data**: For every match, the dataset provides **pre-match betting odds** for both players from multiple top bookmakers. Notably, it includes odds from **Bet365** (for favorite and underdog) and **Pinnacle Sports**, among others[medium.com](https://medium.com/@majdii.karim/tennis-matches-data-analysis-81e6e7658331#:~:text=B365W%20%3D%20Bet365%20odds%20of,match%20winner). It also contains aggregated odds statistics like the **maximum** and **average** odds offered for each player, sourced from odds comparison services (OddsPortal)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@majdii.karim/tennis-matches-data-analysis-81e6e7658331#:~:text=MaxW%3D%20Maximum%20odds%20of%20match,com). These odds are typically the closing odds (just before the match starts), serving as the final market prediction for that match.
- **Outcomes**: Match outcomes are clearly specified – each record identifies the winner (and loser) of the match and often includes the set score. This allows linking the odds to the actual result (win/lose, with no possibility of draw in tennis).
- **Format & Source**: The data is provided in CSV format and is **freely downloadable via Kaggle**[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakeem/atp-and-wta-tennis-data/data#:~:text=ATP%20and%20WTA%20matches%20results,2000%2C%20including%20Grand%20Slams%2C). It was compiled from official ATP/WTA results and odds data from trusted sources like the Tennis-Data site and OddsPortal (which track odds from licensed bookmakers)[medium.com](https://medium.com/@majdii.karim/tennis-matches-data-analysis-81e6e7658331#:~:text=MaxW%3D%20Maximum%20odds%20of%20match,com). The dataset’s credibility is high, and it has a wide usage in sports analytics. It offers a rich, clean structure (dozens of columns including player statistics and odds) that is well-suited for modeling odds movements versus outcomes.

## 3. **NBA Odds (2008–2023)** – Moneylines, Spreads and Totals

- **Coverage**: Historical betting lines for **NBA basketball games** covering the **2008 through 2022 seasons** (with partial 2023 data). This spans roughly 15 full seasons of the NBA, encompassing nearly **20,000 games** in total. Both regular season (and possibly playoff games) are included, with final scores and betting odds recorded for each game[sportsbookreviewsonline.com](https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm#:~:text=Historical%20scores%20and%20odds%20data,and%20closing%20point%20spreads).
- **Odds Data**: The dataset includes **opening and closing odds** for multiple wager types: **moneyline odds** (win/lose odds for each team), **point spreads** (handicap lines with the favorite’s spread and associated odds), and **over/under totals** (projected total points) for each game[sportsbookreviewsonline.com](https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm#:~:text=Historical%20scores%20and%20odds%20data,and%20closing%20point%20spreads). Notably, it also provides **2nd half lines**[sportsbookreviewsonline.com](https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm#:~:text=Historical%20scores%20and%20odds%20data,and%20closing%20point%20spreads) – i.e. odds and point spreads for bets placed at halftime. By capturing opening vs. closing lines, one can observe line movements for each game. All odds are typically from Las Vegas or major sportsbook consensus (the data was originally scraped from Sportsbook Review’s odds archive, a reputable source)[sportsbookreviewsonline.com](https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm#:~:text=Historical%20scores%20and%20odds%20data,and%20closing%20point%20spreads)[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christophertreasure/nba-odds-data#:~:text=NBA%20Odds%20Data%20,the%20nbastatR%20package%20to).
- **Outcomes**: Final game outcomes are included via the recorded **scores**. This allows identification of the game winner (for moneyline bets) and whether it covered the spread or total. Each record links the odds with the actual result (e.g. which team won, by how many points, total points scored vs the line), which is vital for model training.
- **Source & Format**: This dataset was aggregated and shared on Kaggle, with raw data drawn from Sportsbook Review’s **historical NBA odds database**[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christophertreasure/nba-odds-data#:~:text=NBA%20Odds%20Data%20,the%20nbastatR%20package%20to). Data is provided in structured CSV files. It is **publicly accessible** for free. Given that it originates from an authoritative odds archive (which logged odds from well-known sportsbooks like Pinnacle, etc.) and includes official game results, the dataset is quite reliable. The combination of various bet types and the large number of games makes it suitable for modeling how odds evolve and correlate with outcomes in basketball.

## 4. **UFC Mixed Martial Arts Fight Odds (2010–2020)** – Kaggle Dataset

- **Coverage**: Historical odds for **UFC MMA fights** over a **10-year period from March 21, 2010 to March 14, 2020**[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ufc-fights-2010-2020-with-betting-odds/data#:~:text=This%20dataset%20consists%20of%2011,Column). This encompasses every major UFC event in that timeframe – on the order of a few thousand fights across hundreds of events (UFC numbered events and Fight Nights). MMA fights rarely end in draws, so virtually all bouts have a clear winner, fitting the low-draw criterion.
- **Odds Data**: For each fight, the dataset lists the two competitors and their respective **moneyline odds** (win odds) before the fight[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonkwm/ufc-mens-betting-odds-20152020#:~:text=Context,fighter1%20%2C%20fighter2). Typically, one fighter is the favorite (e.g. odds < 1 in decimal, or negative American odds) and the other the underdog. The odds are likely the closing odds for each fighter, reflecting the betting market’s final view. The dataset explicitly provides each **fighter’s odds and the implied probabilities**, as well as other fight details.
- **Outcomes**: The **winner of each fight** is clearly indicated in the data[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonkwm/ufc-mens-betting-odds-20152020#:~:text=Context,fighter1%20%2C%20fighter2) (since draws are extremely rare in UFC, essentially each record is a binary outcome of either fighter1 or fighter2 winning). This allows training models to predict fight outcomes from odds. Additional fields may include event name/date or fight weight class, but the core information for modeling is fighter names, odds, and winner.
- **Format & Source**: This compilation is available on Kaggle as a CSV dataset. It was created by an independent contributor who **scraped the data from online sources** (noting that while there were other UFC datasets, none included betting odds, so they built one)[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ufc-fights-2010-2020-with-betting-odds/data#:~:text=Context,went%20and%20made%20one%20myself). The odds likely come from a reputable sportsbook or aggregator (e.g. Bet365 or BestFightOdds), ensuring realistic market odds. The dataset is free to access, and while community-sourced, it covers official UFC match outcomes and betting lines, making it a valuable resource for MMA analytics.

## 5. **Betfair Exchange Historical Odds (2016–Present)** – Betfair Data Portal

- **Coverage**: The **Betfair Exchange** provides a rich historical odds database covering **multiple sports worldwide** since 2016[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=Betfair%20UK%20give%20access%20to,easily%20accessible%20format%20for%20everyone). Sports include football (soccer), tennis, basketball, cricket, golf, MMA and more – essentially any sport traded on the exchange (Betfair’s “Other Sports” category covers sports like MMA, boxing, etc.)[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,cost). This resource encompasses **thousands of events** per year, and is continuously updated as new events conclude.
- **Odds Data**: Betfair’s data offers **fully time-stamped odds** with high frequency updates. Every change in the betting odds (back and lay prices on the exchange) throughout an event’s lifecycle is recorded. The **free tier** of Betfair’s historical data gives **1-minute interval snapshots** of the odds for each market[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,API%20endpoint%20for%20download%20management), from market opening through to closure. Paid tiers even offer second-by-second data, but for many modeling purposes the 1-minute data is very detailed. Unlike traditional sportsbook odds, exchange data also include **traded volumes** at each price (though volume is available in the paid tiers; the free tier focuses on prices)[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,cost)[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,API%20endpoint%20for%20download%20management). This means you can observe how odds fluctuate over time in reaction to bets and information, making it ideal for time-series analysis.
- **Outcomes**: Each market’s dataset identifies the **winning outcome** (for example, which team won the match, or which fighter won the bout) once the event is settled. In Betfair data, the winner can be inferred from the market settlement or is explicitly indicated (the “winner” selection will show the final price/volume at settlement). Thus, final results are inherently included.
- **Access & Format**: The data is available through Betfair’s **Historical Data portal** with clear terms. Users need a (free) Betfair account to log in and download data. Files are provided in compressed **JSON format** (which can be converted to CSV) for each market[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,cost). The service is **free for basic access** – one can download 1-minute interval data for odds at no cost[betfair.com.au](https://www.betfair.com.au/hub/education/how-to-model/historical-data-sources/#:~:text=,API%20endpoint%20for%20download%20management). This is a reputable, primary-source dataset (direct from a licensed betting exchange operating in many jurisdictions, including Portugal). It is excellent for modeling as it contains granular time-series odds from open to close, for a vast number of events across sports.

Each of the above datasets is **publicly accessible** (free or with free access options) and includes both **odds data and final outcomes**. They cover a range of sports (MMA, tennis, basketball, etc., plus soccer) and come from credible sources like Kaggle community contributors, research projects, or official betting platforms. The data are typically provided in CSV or similar formats for easy use in machine learning pipelines. These resources should equip you with sufficient historical odds and results to train and evaluate an LSTM model on sports betting markets.
