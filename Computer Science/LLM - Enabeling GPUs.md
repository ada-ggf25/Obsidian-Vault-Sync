Enabling GPU in Google Colab is **crucial when training deep learning models**, especially large ones like LLMs, because it drastically accelerates the computations involved. Let me explain in clear detail:

## ⚡ Why It's Important to Enable GPU

### 🧠 1. **Deep Learning Requires Massive Computation**

Training a neural network involves:

- Matrix multiplications
    
- Backpropagation (gradient computation)
    
- Weight updates
    

These operations are very **math-intensive**, especially for large models with millions (or billions) of parameters. Doing this on a CPU is **extremely slow** and often infeasible for large datasets or deeper models.

### ⚙️ 2. **GPUs Are Designed for Parallel Processing**

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) were originally built for rendering images, which also requires **parallel math operations** (like applying filters or shaders to pixels in parallel).

This parallel architecture makes them **ideal for training neural networks**, where:

- You need to apply the same operations to multiple data points (e.g., matrix × vector)
    
- You can process multiple neurons/layers at once

### 🔁 3. **Colab CPU vs GPU vs TPU**

|Hardware|Use Case|Speed|
|---|---|---|
|CPU|General-purpose|🐌 Slow|
|GPU (e.g. Tesla T4, P100)|Deep learning, ML training|⚡ Fast|
|TPU|Very large tensor ops (e.g., large BERT)|🚀 Very fast (but more complex setup)|

## ✅ What You’re Doing in Code

### In TensorFlow:

```python
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

You’re checking whether a GPU device is available. If it returns `> 0`, TensorFlow will automatically use it for computations.

### In PyTorch:

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```

You’re explicitly moving your model to the GPU (`cuda`). This tells PyTorch: _“Do all operations for this model and its tensors on the GPU instead of the CPU.”_

## 🎯 In Google Colab: How to Enable the GPU

1. Go to **`Runtime` > `Change runtime type`**
    
2. Set **Hardware accelerator** to **`GPU`**
    
3. Click **Save**
    

Done — now your code can use GPU acceleration.

## 📈 Example Speed Difference

Training a GPT-like model for 1,000 steps on:

- **CPU**: 1 hour+
    
- **GPU**: ~2–5 minutes
    

---

## 🛑 What Happens If You Don’t Enable GPU?

- Training will still run, but much slower.
    
- Your model may take **hours or even days** to train.
    
- You may run into **memory bottlenecks** faster.

## 🔒 Best Practices

|Tip|Description|
|---|---|
|✅ Always check for `cuda` (PyTorch) or GPU devices (TensorFlow)||
|🚀 Use `torch.cuda.amp` or `tf.keras.mixed_precision` to speed up with half precision||
|🔄 Restart the runtime if switching from CPU to GPU in Colab||
