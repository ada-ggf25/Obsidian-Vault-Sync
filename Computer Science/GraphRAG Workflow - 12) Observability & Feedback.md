Stage 12 is where your GraphRAG stops being a black box. You‚Äôll wire **traces, metrics, logs, and human feedback** end-to-end so you can see _what happened_, _why_, and _how to fix it_. Below is a practical blueprint that maps cleanly onto OpenTelemetry + the best LLM-obs tools (Phoenix, TruLens), with extras for agentic flows.

# What to observe (four signal types)

**1) Traces (who did what, in what order)**

- Use **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** to standardize spans for **LLM calls, agent steps, embeddings, vector searches** and **tool executions**. You‚Äôll capture prompt/response hashes, token usage, model name, latency, and agent tool decisions under a common schema. These conventions exist and are evolving in OTel (status: ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù).
    
- If you run agents, create spans for `plan`, `step{i}`, `tool_execution`, and `synthesis` so you can reconstruct decisions; this lines up with the OTel ‚Äúagent spans‚Äù scope.
    

**2) Metrics (is it fast, cheap, and healthy?)**

- Core: end-to-end latency (p50/p95), retrieval latency, tokens (prompt/ completion/total), ANN params (ef_search/nprobe), cache hit rates, error rates. OTel‚Äôs GenAI metrics define standard names so these are uniform across services.
    

**3) Logs (what exactly ran)**

- Emit **structured logs** for: generated Cypher/SPARQL (redacted + read-only), retrieval parameters, index used, top-k selections, and **evidence IDs** cited in the final answer (node/edge IDs + doc spans). That aligns with GraphRAG‚Äôs emphasis on provenance artifacts.
    

**4) Feedback (is the answer good?)**

- Attach user signals (üëç/üëé + reason codes) and _automatic_ evals (groundedness, context relevance, answer relevance) on every trace, so you can correlate quality with steps, prompts, indexes, and models later. TruLens and Phoenix ship these out-of-the-box.

# Recommended stack (tried-and-true)

- **OpenTelemetry** SDKs + the **GenAI semantic conventions** for vendor-neutral traces/metrics; OpenLLMetry helped standardize many LLM attributes (now part of OTel).
    
- **Arize Phoenix** for live tracing dashboards and LLM/RAG evals (faithfulness, retrieval quality) with OTel ingestion built in. Great for seeing run graphs, prompts, contexts, and per-stage timings.
    
- **TruLens** for the **RAG Triad**‚ÄîContext Relevance, Groundedness, Answer Relevance‚Äîand a library of ‚Äúfeedback functions.‚Äù Easy to run online or offline against traces.
    

(If you‚Äôd rather stick to your own stack, OTel works fine with Grafana/Jaeger/Prometheus; there are public guides detailing this setup for LLM apps.)

# Instrumentation plan (what spans/metrics to create)

Create one root span per request and nest the rest:

1. **Router / Mode selection**
    
    - Attributes: `mode` (local|global|DRIFT), `as_of` time, tenant, query class.
        
2. **Seeding** (parallel)
    
    - Spans: `bm25.search`, `vector.search`, `hybrid.fusion` (store top-k ids/scores).
        
    - Metrics: candidate counts, latency; ANN params (ef_search/nprobe). (Hybrid fusion like RRF is common.)
        
3. **Graph traversals & queries**
    
    - Spans: `traversal.khop`, `path.shortest`, `motif.query`, `query.template`, `text2cypher.exec`.
        
    - Attributes: Cypher hash, rows returned, **time filter applied**, degree/hop caps hit.
        
4. **Re-rank & packaging**
    
    - Spans: `rerank.crossencoder` (if used), `mmr.diversify`, `package.evidence`.
        
    - Attributes: kept vs dropped, citation bundle size.
        
5. **Generation**
    
    - Span: `llm.generate`. Attributes: token counts, temperature, finish reason.
        
    - Attach **auto-eval results** (Triad) to the span as events/metrics.
        
6. **Post-answer**
    
    - Persist `claim ‚Üí evidence` map (IDs and doc spans) and user feedback.

# Dashboards you actually need

- **Golden ‚Äúfour-up‚Äù:** end-to-end latency, total tokens, groundedness score, context recall/precision (from evals). (Phoenix/TruLens expose these directly.)
    
- **Retrieval sheet:** Hits@k, hybrid vs lexical vs vector win rates, average path length, temporal-validity violations.
    
- **Cost panel:** tokens/request, reranker usage %, ANN recalls vs latency (by ef_search/nprobe).
    
- **Drift/freshness:** % answers citing summaries/embeddings older than SLO; ‚Äúas-of‚Äù mismatch rate (ties to Stage 8).
    
- **Top failure slices:** low groundedness by tenant, by question archetype, by index; common ‚Äúno-evidence‚Äù reasons.
    

For interactive debugging of RAG pipelines, research tools like **RAGGY** show how real-time, step-wise introspection shortens the improvement loop; it‚Äôs worth mirroring that UX in your dashboards.

# Feedback loops (how to learn and improve)

**Automatic evals**

- Run **TruLens RAG Triad** online for every answer (fast, LLM-judge or NLI-based). Use alerting on drops.
    
- Add **RAGAS** offline for broader sweeps (faithfulness, context precision/recall) when you batch-test new retrievers.
    
- Consider **eRAG** for retrieval evaluation that correlates better with downstream quality by measuring each document‚Äôs contribution to task accuracy.
    
- Newer studies also validate simple LLM judges for business acceptance decisions (accept/reject) with strong human agreement.
    

**Human-in-the-loop**

- Capture üëç/üëé + **reason codes**: wrong time, wrong entity, missing citation, too slow, not concise.
    
- Provide a ‚Äú**mark supporting evidence**‚Äù UI so reviewers can click the path/text span that _should_ have been used‚Äîthis feeds back into retriever tuning and gold sets.
    

**Closing the loop**

- Route low-groundedness traces into a weekly triage: update templates, add motifs, tighten time windows, or adjust hybrid weights.
    
- Promote frequently corrected answers to **golden tests** so regressions are caught in CI.

# Agent observability (if you use agentic traversal)

You‚Äôll want to detect ‚Äúreasoning loops‚Äù, tool misuse, and prompt-injection side effects. Recent work on **AgentOps** and **AgentSight** (eBPF-based, system-level tracing that correlates LLM intent with OS-level actions) shows practical ways to catch these pathologies and even prompt-injection outcomes at runtime. If your flows are agentic, add a panel for **step count, tool error rate, and repeat-step loops**.

---

# CI/CD & alerts

- **Pre-merge**: run offline evals (RAGAS / Triad) on golden sets; gate on minimum groundedness and context recall.
    
- **Canary**: ship to a small slice with **Phoenix** tracing + online evaluators and alert if groundedness/latency/token budget regress > X%.
    
- **On-call alerts**: spikes in timeouts, ANN fallbacks, or ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù answers; groundedness under threshold for N minutes.
    

---

# Data & privacy notes

- Scrub PII from prompts and traces; log **hashes** for prompts/responses when needed.
    
- Keep **provenance IDs** (node/edge/doc span) instead of raw text to minimize exposure; render the text only on demand in secured UIs (matches GraphRAG‚Äôs provenance mindset).

# Minimal implementation checklist

1. Instrument with **OTel GenAI** (spans for seeds, traversals, Text2Cypher, rerank, generation).
    
2. Pipe traces to **Phoenix** (UI) and/or your OTel backend; enable RAG evals.
    
3. Add **TruLens** online evaluators (Triad) + reason-coded user feedback.
    
4. Build dashboards for latency/tokens/groundedness, retrieval quality, freshness, and agent loops.
    
5. Gate releases in CI on offline evals; canary with online eval alerts.
    

If you share your current stack (Neo4j + which vector store + Phoenix/TruLens preferences), I‚Äôll sketch the exact span/metric names to emit (per OTel GenAI), a Phoenix workspace layout, and the alert rules that map cleanly to your SLOs.
