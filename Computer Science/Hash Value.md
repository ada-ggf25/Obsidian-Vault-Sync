A **hash value** is a fixed-size integer computed from an object that summarizes its contents/identity.

In Python:

- It’s the result of the object’s `__hash__()` method → an `int`.
- **Equal objects must have equal hashes** (`a == b ⇒ hash(a) == hash(b)`).
- **Unequal objects can share a hash** (a _collision_), but Python’s dict/set handle this internally.
- Hash values are used to place and find keys quickly in **hash tables** (Python’s `dict` and `set`).

### Why it matters

- Only **hashable** objects (stable hash over their lifetime, usually immutable) can be dict keys / set members or used by `functools.cache`.

### Quick examples

```python
hash(42)            # integer is hashable
hash(("x", 1))      # tuple of hashables is hashable
# hash([1, 2])      # TypeError: list is unhashable (mutable)

```

### Notes & gotchas

- The hash for strings and some other built-ins is **randomized per process** for security, so `hash("abc")` can differ between Python runs (controlled by `PYTHONHASHSEED`).
- Custom classes: if you define `__eq__`, also define `__hash__` (or use `@dataclass(frozen=True)`) to keep them hashable and consistent.

**In one line:** a hash value is a fast-to-compute integer “fingerprint” that lets Python look up objects quickly in dictionaries and sets.

---

Great question — it’s **neither** the memory address nor a pointer.

- **`id(obj)`** (in CPython) is _pointer-like_: a number that uniquely identifies that **particular object instance** during its lifetime (often its memory address). Two equal-but-distinct objects have **different** `id`s.
- **`hash(obj)`** is a **content-based fingerprint** (an integer) used for **hash tables** (`dict`, `set`, `functools.cache`). Objects that are **equal** must have the **same** hash, even if they live at different addresses.

Think of it this way:

- `id` → “**where** is this object?” (identity/location)
- `hash` → “**what** is this object (for equality)?” (value summary)

### Quick demo (conceptually)

```python
a = "hello"
b = "".join(["he", "llo"])   # a separate string object with same value

id(a) != id(b)               # different objects (likely different addresses)
hash(a) == hash(b)           # same value → same hash
a == b                       # True

```

### Extra notes

- Hashes aren’t “allocated in memory for a variable.” They’re usually **computed** from the object’s value; some types (like `str`) cache their hash internally after first computation.
- Different unequal objects can share a hash (**collision**); dicts/sets handle that.
- String (and some) hashes are **randomized per process**, so `hash("hello")` can differ between runs (security feature).
- Only **hashable** (usually immutable) objects can be dict keys / set members.

So: **hash ≠ pointer**. Use `id()` for identity/location; use `hash()` for fast lookup by value.

---

Not quite—hash is **about the object’s value**, not its identity.

- **`id(obj)`** ≈ identity/location of _that particular instance_ (pointer-like). Two equal objects can have different `id`s.
- **`hash(obj)`** ≈ a numeric **fingerprint of the value** used for dict/set lookups. If `a == b`, then **`hash(a) == hash(b)`** must hold (even if `id(a) != id(b)`).

Also, in Python **variables are just names**; the hash belongs to the **object** they reference.

Quick examples:

```python
a = "cat"
b = "".join(["c","a","t"])  # different object with same value

id(a) != id(b)          # usually different
a == b                  # True (same value)
hash(a) == hash(b)      # True (same hash)

lst = [1,2,3]
# hash(lst) -> TypeError (lists are mutable → value can change → not hashable)

```

So: hash ≠ ID. Hash summarizes the **content** (for equality); ID identifies the **instance**.

---

Almost—hash is a **compact fingerprint derived from the object’s value**, not the value itself.

- Think of it like a **barcode**: it’s computed _from_ the contents so objects with equal value get the **same hash**, but the hash is much shorter and **can’t reconstruct** the original value.
- It’s used by hash tables (`dict`, `set`, `functools.cache`) for **fast lookup**.

Key points:

- **Value-based:** `a == b` ⇒ `hash(a) == hash(b)`.
- **Not identity:** different objects with same value have same hash even if `id()` differs.
- **Not full information:** many different values can share a hash (collisions).
- **Stable only for immutables:** mutable types (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `set`) are unhashable because their value can change.
- **Per-run randomization:** some built-ins (e.g., `str`) have hashes that differ between Python runs for security.

Quick examples:

```python
hash("abc")          # works: strings are immutable (hash summarizes text)
hash((1, 2, 3))      # works: tuple of hashables
# hash([1, 2, 3])    # TypeError: list is mutable → unhashable

```

So: **hash ≠ the data**, but a small integer **computed from the data** to make lookups fast.

---

Close, but tweak the wording:

- It’s **not for the variable** (names are just labels).
- It’s a **fingerprint of the object’s _value_**: `hash(obj)` is a small integer computed from the data so equal values get the same hash.
- It is **not identity**. `id(obj)` is the instance’s identity (pointer-like); two equal objects can have different `id`s but must share the same `hash`.

Think:

- **`id`** ≈ device **serial number** (who/where this exact object is).
- **`hash`** ≈ **barcode of the contents** (what the value is, for fast lookups).

Caveats:

- Many different values can share a hash (collisions) → you can’t recover the data from the hash.
- Only **hashable (usually immutable)** objects have a hash.
- Some hashes (e.g., strings) are randomized per run for security.

So: hash = content fingerprint; id = object identity.
