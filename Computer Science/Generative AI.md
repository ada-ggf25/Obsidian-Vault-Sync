### üî≠ **1. Overview of Generative AI Domains**

| Domain         | Primary Models                    | Example Use Cases                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**       | LLMs (GPT, T5, BERT + Decoder)    | Chatbots, summarisation, code generation      |
| **Image**      | GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models      | Image synthesis, super-resolution, inpainting |
| **Audio**      | WaveNet, Jukebox, GAN-TTS         | Music generation, speech synthesis            |
| **Video**      | MoCoGAN, DALL-E 3 + video modules | Video prediction, animation                   |
| **3D/Spatial** | NeRF, GANcraft, PointFlow         | 3D object generation, view synthesis          |
| **Multimodal** | CLIP, Flamingo, Gemini, Kosmos    | Image+text generation, VQA, storytelling      |

### üß† **2. Core Generative Architectures**

#### üìå GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

- Good for: Image generation (e.g., StyleGAN, BigGAN)
    
- Key idea: Generator vs Discriminator in a min-max game
    
- Limitation: Mode collapse, unstable training
    

#### üìå VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)

- Good for: Controlled generation, interpolation
    
- Key idea: Learn probabilistic latent space with reconstruction loss + KL divergence
    

#### üìå Diffusion Models

- Good for: High-quality, controllable image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Imagen)
    
- Key idea: Gradual noise injection and denoising to learn data distribution
    

#### üìå Autoregressive Models

- Good for: Sequential data (text, audio, image pixels)
    
- Examples: PixelRNN/CNN, WaveNet, Jukebox
    

#### üìå NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)

- Good for: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis
