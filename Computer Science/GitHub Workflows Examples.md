Got you. Here’s what every line does and why it’s there.

```
name: flake8

```

Gives this workflow a human-readable name. You’ll see “flake8” in the Actions tab.

```
on:

```

Top-level key declaring when this workflow should run (its triggers).

```
   # Trigger the workflow on push or pull
   # but only for the master branch

```

Just a comment for humans. No effect on execution.

```
   push:

```

Runs the workflow on any git push…

```
     branches:
       - master

```

…but only if the push targets the `master` branch. (If your default branch is `main`, change this.)

```
   pull_request:

```

Also run for pull requests…

```
     branches:
       - master

```

…but only PRs whose base/target branch is `master`.

```
jobs:

```

Container for one or more jobs (independent units that can run in parallel).

```
  flake8:

```

The ID of this job (you’ll see it as a section in the run logs).

```
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

```

Chooses the GitHub-hosted runner VM image to execute the job. Here: the latest Ubuntu image.

```
    steps:

```

A job is a sequence of steps executed on the runner.

```
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

```

First step: use the official `checkout` action (v4) to pull your repository’s code onto the runner so later steps can access it.

```
    - name: Set up Python 3.13

```

A friendly label for the next step as it appears in logs.

```
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5

```

Calls the official action that installs/configures Python on the runner.

```
      with:
        python-version: "3.13"

```

Inputs to the action: request Python version 3.13 for subsequent steps.

```
    - name: Install dependencies

```

Label for the dependency-installation step.

```
      run: |
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8

```

A shell script executed on the runner:

- upgrades `pip` (good habit to avoid old installer bugs),
- installs `flake8` into the just-set Python environment.

```
    - name: Lint with flake8

```

Label for the linting step.

```
      run: |
        flake8 .

```

Runs flake8 against the repository root (`.`). It reads config from `.flake8`, `setup.cfg`, or `pyproject.toml` if present. The step exits non-zero on violations, failing the job.

### Nice improvements you might add (optional)

- Trigger on your actual default branch:
    
    ```yaml
    branches: [main]
    
    ```
    
- Fail PRs but don’t block pushes to feature branches:
    
    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]
      pull_request:
        branches: [main]
    
    ```
    
- Cache Python packages to speed up runs:
    
    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.13"
        cache: "pip"
    - run: pip install -U pip flake8
    
    ```
    
- Pin flake8 (reproducibility):
    
    ```yaml
    pip install flake8==7.1.1
    
    ```
    
- Add arguments (e.g., ignore, max line length):
    
    ```yaml
    flake8 . --max-line-length=120
    
    ```
    
- Consider `ruff` for faster linting, or use pre-commit in CI:
    
    ```yaml
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit run --all-files
    
    ```
    

If you want, paste your `.flake8`/`pyproject.toml` and I’ll tailor the command and CI to match your rules.

Here’s a line-by-line walkthrough of your workflow, plus a few tiny tweaks to make it sturdier.

```
name: pytest-unit-tests

```

Human-readable workflow name shown in the Actions tab.

```
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull reque
  # but only for the master branch

```

`on:` declares triggers. The comments are for humans (typo in “reque” is fine).

```
  push:
    branches:
      - master

```

Run the workflow on any push **to the `master` branch**. If your default is `main`, change this.

```
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

```

Also run for PRs whose **base** branch is `master`. Great for gating merges.

```
jobs:

```

Top-level container for one or more jobs.

```
  pytest:
    name: unit testing

```

Defines a job with ID `pytest` and a friendly display name “unit testing”.

```
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

```

Use GitHub’s latest Ubuntu runner VM.

```
    steps:

```

Ordered steps executed on that VM.

```
    - name: Checkout simple_functions
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

```

Fetch your repo onto the runner so later steps can read code, tests, and config.

```
    - name: Set up Python 3.13
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.13"

```

Install/configure Python 3.13 for subsequent steps. (Good to keep CI aligned with your project’s supported versions.)

```
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e .
        pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Shell block:

- upgrade `pip`;
    
- install your package in **editable** mode (`e .`). This requires a `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517/621) or `setup.py` in the repo;
    
- then install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    
    Tip: many projects install requirements **before** `-e .` (so the package can resolve extras during build), but either can work. Ensure `pytest` (and any plugins like `pytest-cov`) are listed somewhere—either here or in a dev requirements file.
    

```
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest tests/

```

Run the test suite under the `tests/` directory. Pytest exits non-zero on failures, which fails the job.

## Quick improvements (optional but handy)

- Trigger on your actual default branch:
    
    ```yaml
    on:
      push: { branches: [main] }
      pull_request: { branches: [main] }
    
    ```
    
- Speed up installs with built-in pip cache:
    
    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: "3.13"
        cache: pip
    
    ```
    
- Ensure tools are present (if not in `requirements.txt`):
    
    ```yaml
    - run: pip install -U pip pytest pytest-cov
    
    ```
    
- Useful pytest flags & artifacts:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Test with pytest (coverage + junit)
      run: |
        pytest -q --maxfail=1 \\
               --cov=your_package_name --cov-report=xml \\
               --junitxml=pytest-junit.xml tests/
    - name: Upload coverage.xml
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: coverage
        path: coverage.xml
    - name: Upload junit report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: junit
        path: pytest-junit.xml
    
    ```
    
- Test multiple Python versions:
    
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      pytest:
        strategy:
          matrix:
            python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
              cache: pip
          # ... installs and pytest as before
    
    ```
    

If you paste your `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` / `requirements*.txt`, I’ll tailor the install step and pytest flags precisely to your project.
