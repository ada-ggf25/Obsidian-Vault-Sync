Below is a complete guide to unlocking the Galaxy Brain achievement on GitHub, from its definition and tiers to the exact steps you need to take—and some common pitfalls to avoid.

## Overview

The Galaxy Brain badge celebrates your helpfulness in GitHub Discussions: once at least **two** of your answers are accepted, you’ll earn the base Galaxy Brain achievement on your profile. Higher tiers unlock as you accumulate more accepted answers—making it both a way to support fellow developers and to showcase your expertise.

## What Is the Galaxy Brain Achievement?

### Purpose

The Galaxy Brain badge rewards you for providing **accepted answers** in GitHub Discussions attached to **public repositories**. It’s designed to encourage knowledgeable, accurate responses to community questions. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/18293?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Tiers

Galaxy Brain is tiered:

- **Base (bronze‑style icon):** 2 accepted answers
    
- **Silver tier:** 8 accepted answers
    
- **Gold tier:** 16 accepted answers
    
- **Platinum tier:** 32 accepted answers [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/18293?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

## How to Earn Galaxy Brain

### 1. Engage in Public‑Repository Discussions

Navigate to the **Discussions** tab of any public repository—avoid the main GitHub Community forum, as achievements there have been disabled to curb low‑quality posts. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/48448?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2. Provide Thoughtful, Correct Answers

Find questions that match your expertise, then write clear, concise, well‑researched responses. The better your answer, the more likely it will be marked accepted. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/64016?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. Get Your Answers “Accepted”

An answer is only counted when the **original poster** (or a user with sufficient permissions) clicks “Accept answer.” Self‑accepts on your own questions do **not** count. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/112973?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 4. Monitor Your Progress

Once you have **two** accepted answers, you’ll see the Galaxy Brain badge appear on your profile under “Achievements.” Additional badges upgrade automatically as you hit the higher thresholds.

## Tips & Considerations

- **Don’t mark your own answers.** Only answers accepted by **others** count toward the badge. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/112973?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Use active repos.** Choose projects with vibrant discussion boards for faster acceptance.
    
- **Be patient.** Acceptance can sometimes take hours or days, depending on project maintainers.
    
- **Quality over quantity.** A single great answer is more impactful than many mediocre ones.
    

## Troubleshooting

- If your badge doesn’t appear after two accepted answers, ensure those answers were in **public repository discussions**, not Community Discussions (which no longer award achievements). [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/18293?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Check that **self‑accepts** haven’t inadvertently been used—only others marking you counts. [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/112973?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Review your GitHub settings to ensure achievements display on your profile (they’re opt‑out by default, but you may have disabled them). [GitHub](https://github.com/drknzz/GitHub-Achievements?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
