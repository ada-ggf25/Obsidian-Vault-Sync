Short answer: **no difference.**  
`git stage` is just a synonym for `git add` — both put selected changes into the **staging area (index)** for the next commit.

### Notes

- On some older Git versions, `git stage` may not exist unless someone set an alias like:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global alias.stage add
    ```
    
- Functionally they’re identical:
    
    ```bash
    git add file.py      # stages file.py
    git stage file.py    # same thing
    ```
    

### Related commands

- See what’s staged vs not:
    
    ```bash
    git diff            # unstaged changes
    git diff --staged   # what will be committed
    ```
    
- Unstage:
    
    ```bash
    git restore --staged path/to/file
    ```
    
- Commit staged changes:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "message"
    ```
