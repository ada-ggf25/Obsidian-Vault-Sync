Do you mean one of these?

- **PyPI (Python Package Index)** — the main repository of Python packages you install with `pip` (e.g., `pip install numpy`). Browse/search at [pypi.org](http://pypi.org), and `pip install <package>` pulls from there.
- **PYPL Index (Popularity of Programming Language)** — a monthly ranking (“PopularitY of Programming Language”) that estimates language popularity from search trends.
- **PYPL (PayPal ticker)** — the stock symbol for PayPal Holdings on NASDAQ.

If you tell me which one you meant, I’ll go deeper (e.g., how to publish to PyPI, how the PYPL index is calculated, or PYPL’s latest stats).
