## Summary

GitHub Copilot in VS Code provides three distinct chat modes—**Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**—each tailored to different workflows. **Ask** mode is a conversational interface for questions, explanations, and brainstorming without directly modifying your files [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com). **Edit** mode lets you specify which files or contexts Copilot should change, applying natural‑language‑driven code edits inline in the editor [Visual Studio CodeVisual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits?utm_source=chatgpt.com). **Agent** mode goes further: it autonomously determines context, iterates through multi‑step plans, and can invoke tools or run terminal commands to fulfill complex, workspace‑wide requests [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-chat/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Ask Mode

- **Purpose**: Use when you want to **ask questions**, **explain code**, or **brainstorm ideas** related to coding and technology.
- **Behavior**: Copilot responds in the chat window with text explanations, examples, or code snippets—but **does not** automatically apply changes to your files.
- **How to use**:
    1. Open the Chat view (`View` → `GitHub Copilot Chat` or `⌃⌘I` / `Ctrl+Alt+I`).
    2. Select **Ask** from the mode dropdown.
    3. Enter your natural‑language question and press **Enter**.
- **Examples**:
    - “What is the factory design pattern?”
    - “How do I use the Fetch API in JavaScript?”
    - “Explain the algorithm in this function.” [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Edit Mode

- **Purpose**: Ideal for **targeted code edits** when you know exactly **which files** or **code regions** to change.
- **Behavior**: You add context (files, folders, or inline selection) to your prompt; Copilot then suggests and **applies edits directly** in the editor overlay, which you can accept or discard.
- **How to use**:
    1. Open the Chat view.
    2. Select **Edit** from the mode dropdown.
    3. Click **Add Context** to include specific files or the active editor.
    4. Enter your edit prompt (e.g., “Refactor this function to be async”) and press **Enter**.
    5. Review and **Keep** or **Undo** the suggested edits.
- **Use case**: Renaming functions, updating configuration across files, or refactoring code with precise scope. [Visual Studio CodeVisual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Agent Mode

- **Purpose**: Best for **complex, multi‑step tasks** where Copilot can autonomously plan, execute, and iterate across your entire workspace.
- **Behavior**: Copilot determines relevant context without manual file selection, may invoke **built‑in or extension‑provided tools**, run **terminal commands**, and perform **multiple internal requests** to fulfill your prompt end‑to‑end.
- **How to use**:
    1. Ensure `chat.agent.enabled` is set to `true` in your settings (requires VS Code 1.99+).
    2. Open the Chat view and select **Agent** from the dropdown.
    3. Enter a high‑level prompt (e.g., “Add social media sharing and tests for this app”) and press **Enter**.
    4. Confirm any suggested terminal commands or follow‑up actions.
    5. Review the final set of edits and commands.
- **Tip**: Control the maximum internal iterations with `chat.agent.maxRequests`. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-chat/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

**In practice**, choose **Ask** when you need information or brainstorming, **Edit** when you have a clear, scoped change in mind, and **Agent** when you want Copilot to take the lead on larger, cross‑file projects.

## Summary

GitHub Copilot’s new **agent mode** acts as an autonomous peer programmer, capable of iteratively generating, editing, and self‑healing code until your prompt is fully satisfied [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Introduced as a preview in February 2025 for VS Code Insiders and now rolling out to stable releases, agent mode extends beyond one‑off completions by orchestrating multi‑step workflows—installing dependencies, running tests, and even suggesting terminal commands for you to approve [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/vibe-coding-with-github-copilot-agent-mode-and-mcp-support-rolling-out-to-all-vs-code-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Built on top of Copilot Edits with Gemini 2.0 Flash in the model picker, agent mode alongside Copilot Edits delivers a unified AI‑driven coding experience from chat and multi‑file edits to fully autonomous agents [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/newsroom/press-releases/agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Overview of Agent Mode

Agent mode transforms Copilot into a dynamic collaborator that not only writes code but also **iterates on its own output**, catching and fixing errors without manual intervention [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/newsroom/press-releases/agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Leveraging a suite of AI tools, it autonomously determines relevant file contexts, proposes patch‑based edits, installs packages, runs tests, and monitors runtime outputs—looping until the task is complete [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Iteration**: Agent mode will iterate on both its code suggestions and the results of those suggestions, inferring and completing subtasks beyond the original prompt [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Self‑Healing**: It recognizes compile and lint errors at runtime and auto‑corrects them through repeated loops, freeing you from context‑switching between terminal and editor [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Terminal Command Suggestions**: Inline suggestions for `npm install`, `pytest`, or other shell commands appear in the chat, and you can execute or edit them before running [visualstudiomagazine.com](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2025/03/06/New-VS-Code-Release-Polishes-Experimental-GitHub-Copilot-Agent-Mode.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Collapsed & Editable Commands**: In VS Code 1.98+, agent mode introduces a collapsed suggestion gutter and editable inline terminal commands that you can quickly confirm with `Ctrl+Enter`/`⌘+Enter` [visualstudiomagazine.com](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2025/03/06/New-VS-Code-Release-Polishes-Experimental-GitHub-Copilot-Agent-Mode.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
