PEP 257 is **Python’s Docstring Conventions**—guidelines for how to write the string literals that document modules, classes, functions, and methods.

## Core rules (TL;DR)

- Put a **docstring as the first statement** in a module/class/function.
- Use **triple quotes** (`"""..."""`). One-line docstrings fit on one line.
- Start with a **single-sentence summary** in **imperative mood** (“Return x…”, “Compute the FFT…”).
- For multi-line docstrings:
    - Summary line, then a **blank line**, then details.
    - Wrap/indent to match code indentation.
- Don’t leave a blank line **immediately after** the opening `"""` or before the closing `"""`.
- Document public objects; private ones are optional.
- Classes: docstring describes behavior; **init**’s parameters are documented in the class docstring (not necessarily in `__init__` itself).

## Tiny examples

**One-liner**

```python
def norm(x):
    """Return the Euclidean norm of vector x."""

```

**Multi-line**

```python
def read_csv(path, *, delimiter=","):
    """Read a delimited text file.

    The first row is treated as headers. Returns a list of dicts.
    """

```

**Class**

```python
class Vector:
    """Immutable n-dimensional vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : sequence of float
        Components of the vector.
    """

```

## How it relates to other styles

- PEP 257 covers **structure and tone**, not a full parameter/returns format.
- Content styles like **Google** and **NumPy** build on PEP 257 for parameter sections. Any is fine as long as you follow PEP 257’s structure.
- **pydocstyle** (formerly `pep257`) is a linter that checks these rules.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Docstring is first statement
- [ ] Clear one-sentence summary (imperative)
- [ ] Multi-line: summary → blank line → details
- [ ] Proper indentation; no extra leading/trailing blank line inside quotes
- [ ] Public API covered

If you tell me your preferred content style (Google vs NumPy), I can template your project’s docstrings accordingly.
