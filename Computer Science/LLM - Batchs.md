Great question — the concept of **batches** is a core part of how we efficiently train large language models (LLMs). Understanding it well helps you control **speed, memory, and stability** of training.

## 📦 What Is a Batch?

When you train an LLM, you don't update the model one example at a time (too slow), and you usually can't process the entire dataset at once (too big for memory). So you process the data in **batches**.

> A **batch** is a small subset of the training data used to compute **one forward + backward pass** through the network.

## 🧠 Why Use Batches?

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|✅ **Speed**|Vectorised operations on multiple samples are faster than one-by-one|
|✅ **Memory Control**|Fits in GPU memory (vs entire dataset)|
|✅ **Gradient Smoothing**|Averages gradients across several examples — more stable updates|

## ⚙️ Batch Size in Practice

|Batch Size|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Small (e.g., 8–32)**|Slower but uses less memory; more noisy gradients|
|**Medium (e.g., 64–256)**|Balanced trade-off|
|**Large (e.g., 512–4096+)**|Fast, smooth updates — but can overfit or require special tuning (e.g. learning rate scaling)|

For LLMs, you often use **very large batch sizes** with **gradient accumulation** or **model parallelism**.

## 👨‍🏫 Example: Character-Level Model

Imagine your model is trained on:

```
"To be or not to be."
```

With:

- `block_size = 8` (how many characters per training sample)
    
- `batch_size = 4`
    

You randomly select 4 starting positions in the text and get 4 sequences like:

|Input (x)|Target (y)|
|---|---|
|"To be or"|"o be or "|
|" be or n"|"be or no"|
|"ot to be"|"t to be."|
|" be or n"|"be or no"|

This batch is passed into the model **simultaneously** for one update.

## 🔄 How It Works During Training

For each step:

1. Get a batch of `x` (inputs) and `y` (next characters)
    
2. Run `forward()` on the batch
    
3. Compute **loss** between predictions and actual `y`
    
4. Compute **gradients**
    
5. Apply **optimizer step** to update model weights
    

Repeat.

## 🔢 Tensor Shapes

For a batch of shape `(B, T)` where:

- `B = batch size`
    
- `T = block size (context window)`
    

You’ll see:

- **Input tensor**: `[32, 64]` → 32 sequences, each 64 tokens
    
- **Output logits**: `[32, 64, vocab_size]`
    
- **Target tensor**: `[32, 64]`
    

Loss is calculated token-by-token across the batch.

## 🧪 Batch Strategy for LLMs

|Strategy|Use|
|---|---|
|**Random sampling**|Shuffle batches to reduce bias|
|**Gradient Accumulation**|Simulate large batch sizes when memory is limited|
|**Distributed Batching**|Use multiple GPUs (each handles a chunk of batch)|
|**Token-level batching**|For large datasets, pack sequences efficiently to minimise padding|

---

## ✅ Summary

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Batch**|A group of training examples used in one model update|
|**Why?**|Balances memory, speed, and convergence quality|
|**Batch size matters**|Too small = slow/noisy. Too large = may overfit or need tuning|
|**LLMs**|Use massive batches, often distributed across GPUs|
