Great question—think of Git as three places:

1. **Working directory**: your files on disk (editable).
    
2. **Staging area (index)**: a checklist of _exact changes_ you plan to include.
    
3. **Repository (history)**: snapshots (commits) already saved.
    

## The difference

|Command|What it acts on|What it does|When you use it|
|---|---|---|---|
|`git add <files>`|Working dir → **Staging**|Selects specific changes to include in the next commit.|You’ve edited files and want to include _some or all_ of those edits.|
|`git commit -m "msg"`|**Staging** → Repository|Saves a snapshot (commit) of _what’s currently staged_.|After staging the changes you want recorded in history.|

Short version: **`add` picks changes; `commit` records them.**

## Typical flow

```bash
# edit files...
git status               # see what's changed
git add file1.py dir/    # stage selected changes (not everything)
git commit -m "Implement feature X"
```

## Useful variations

- Stage everything changed (tracked files only):
    
    ```bash
    git add -A          # or: git add .
    ```
    
- Commit and auto-stage tracked files in one step:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Quick fix"   # (won’t add brand-new, untracked files)
    ```
    
- Stage only part of a file (interactive hunk picking):
    
    ```bash
    git add -p
    ```
    
- Amend the last commit (message or staged fixes):
    
    ```bash
    git commit --amend
    ```
    
- Unstage something you added by mistake:
    
    ```bash
    git restore --staged path/to/file   # (keeps your edits in working dir)
    ```
    
- See what’s staged vs not:
    
    ```bash
    git diff            # unstaged changes
    git diff --staged   # what will be committed
    ```
    

## And then what?

- **`git push`** uploads your _commits_ to the remote (GitHub). You can’t push unstaged/committed work—only commits.
    

If you want, paste `git status` output and I’ll show exactly what’s staged, what isn’t, and the next commands to run.
