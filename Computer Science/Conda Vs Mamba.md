Short and clear:

- **conda** = the original **package & environment manager** (Python-based).
    
- **mamba** = a **drop-in faster reimplementation** of conda’s solver/installer in C++ (uses **libsolv**), with **parallel** dependency solving & downloads.
    

### What stays the same

- Same commands & UX (`create`, `install`, `update`, channels, envs).
    
- Same env format (`environment.yml`), same metadata, same channels (e.g., `conda-forge`).
    
- You can mix them in the **same base install**.
    

### What’s different

- **Speed**: mamba is much faster, especially for large envs (NumPy, PyTorch, GDAL, etc.).
    
- **Binary**: mamba is compiled C++; conda’s classic solver is Python.
    
- **Flavors**:
    
    - **mamba**: CLI compatible with conda.
        
    - **micromamba**: tiny single binary—great for CI/containers/bootstrapping.
        

### Current best practice (WSL/Linux)

- Either install **Mambaforge** (mamba preinstalled, defaults to conda-forge), **or** add mamba to conda’s base:
    
    ```bash
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
    ```
    
- Then use mamba for heavy ops:
    
    ```bash
    mamba create -n py311 python=3.11
    mamba activate py311        # or: conda activate py311
    mamba install numpy pandas
    ```
    

### Bonus: conda with the libmamba solver

Modern conda can also use the **libmamba** solver (similar speed to mamba):

```bash
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

(You can keep using `conda install ...` with near-mamba performance.)

### Tips

- Use **one process at a time** (don’t run conda and mamba simultaneously on the same env).
    
- It’s fine to use `pip` **inside** a conda/mamba env for packages not on conda-forge.
    
- Keep `channel_priority strict` for predictable resolves.
    

If you tell me your target stack (e.g., PyTorch + CUDA on WSL), I’ll give you a ready-to-paste env spec.

Mostly, yes—use **mamba** for day-to-day installs and env creation because it’s much faster. But you don’t have to be dogmatic.

## TL;DR

- **Default:** use **mamba** (or install conda’s **libmamba** solver) for `create` / `install` / `update`.
    
- **Also fine:** keep using the `conda` command itself—just switch its solver to libmamba for near-mamba speed.
    

```bash
# Option A: Use mamba (recommended)
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
mamba create -n py311 python=3.11
mamba install -n py311 numpy pandas

# Option B: Keep conda CLI but make it fast
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
# now: conda create/install is fast
```

## When mamba shines

- Big scientific stacks (NumPy, PyTorch/TensorFlow, GDAL, OpenCV, CUDA).
    
- Frequent environment solves (research, notebooks, CI).
    
- Using **conda-forge** (broadest coverage) with `channel_priority strict`.
    

## When plain conda is fine

- Small, pure-Python projects.
    
- You’re following a tutorial that assumes `conda` and you don’t want to deviate.
    
- Corporate setups that only permit the `defaults` channel and tightly control tooling.
    

## Practical tips

- Pick **one process at a time** per env (don’t run `conda install` and `mamba install` simultaneously).
    
- Activation is the same: `conda activate myenv` (works whether you used mamba or conda to create it).
    
- It’s okay to `pip install` **inside** a conda/mamba env for packages not on conda-forge.
    
- If starting fresh, consider **Mambaforge** (mamba preinstalled, conda-forge by default).
    

If you tell me your target stack (e.g., PyTorch + CUDA on WSL for your MSc), I’ll give you a ready-to-paste `environment.yml`.
