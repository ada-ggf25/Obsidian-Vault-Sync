Awesome—Stage 1 is where you lock in **what “a fact” looks like** in your system and how time, provenance, and text all hang together. Below is a practical, build-ready menu of **knowledge-modelling choices** for a complex GraphRAG, with trade-offs and when to pick them. I’ll reference the strongest public docs as we go.

# 1) Choose your base graph paradigm

## A. Property Graph (PG) — mainstream for GraphRAG

- **What it is:** Nodes + typed relationships, both with properties; queried with Cypher/GQL.
    
- **Why it’s common:** Direct fit for entity-relationship facts, fast traversals, simple to annotate with text/provenance. Neo4j’s modelling guidance stresses designing for the queries you need and keeping “anchor” data easy to index. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-modeling/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is graph data modeling? - Getting Started"))
    
- **When to pick:** Most enterprise GraphRAG stacks; you want flexible schemas and performant path/neighbor queries.
    

## B. RDF / Triplestore

- **What it is:** Triples (subject–predicate–object) with formal ontologies and **SHACL** validation; queried with SPARQL.
    
- **Why pick it:** Standards, reasoning, shape validation and interop (e.g., cross-org vocabularies). **SHACL** gives you first-class schema constraints; **OWL-Time** gives a canonical vocabulary for temporal concepts. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ "Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)"))
    
- **When to pick:** Regulated / cross-org graphs where **schema conformance** and **interoperability** trump raw traversal speed.
    

> Tip: You can _hybridise_: store the operational PG for retrieval speed and export/ingest an RDF view for validation or exchange.

# 2) Decide how you represent relations (binary vs n-ary)

- **Binary edges with properties (PG default):** `(A)-[:REL {p:…}]->(B)` is compact and fast for simple facts.
    
- **Relationship-as-node (event/statement node):** Model an _event_ or _claim_ as its own node and attach participants as edges. This is the pragmatic way to capture **n-ary** facts, qualifiers, and provenance in PGs, and it mirrors the W3C’s n-ary design pattern in RDF. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/ "Defining N-ary Relations on the Semantic Web"))
    
- **When to use event/statement nodes:** multi-party events (orders, deployments, clinical procedures), facts with qualifiers (who/where/when/source) or multiple time attributes.
    

# 3) Temporal modelling (build it in early)

- **Valid-time properties on nodes/edges:** `valid_from`, `valid_to` (or an interval). Good default for “as of T” queries.
    
- **Snapshotting:** periodic immutable snapshots for coarse time-travel + easy rollbacks.
    
- **Bi-temporal:** valid time **and** transaction time (when the fact entered the graph)—best for auditability.
    
- **Semantic layer:** if you’re in RDF land, lean on **OWL-Time** concepts (instants, intervals, relations) for consistency. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/ "Time Ontology in OWL"))
    

# 4) Text, claims, and provenance (GraphRAG-specific glue)

- **Text units / chunks:** keep **document chunks** as first-class nodes so every entity/edge can cite exact source spans. Microsoft’s GraphRAG pipeline formalises _TextUnits_, _Entities_, _Relationships_, and _Community Reports_ for this reason. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/default_dataflow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dataflow - GraphRAG"))
    
- **Claim/statement nodes:** represent extracted statements (with optional time bounds) as nodes linked to their supporting TextUnits; this cleanly supports **grounded citations** and “show your work.” ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/default_dataflow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dataflow - GraphRAG"))
    

# 5) Schema strategy (how strict should you be?)

- **Schema-first (prescriptive):** fix labels/types & mandatory props up front (governed domains).
    
- **Schema-light (descriptive):** allow evolution; tighten constraints once question patterns stabilise.
    
- **Ontology-guided:** map domain ontology → graph schema; optimisations can materially affect traversal cost (see ontology-driven schema optimisation results). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11580?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Property Graph Schema Optimization for Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs"))
    
- **Validation:**
    
    - **PG world:** descriptive/prescriptive schemas are still evolving; research and vendor patterns show how to enforce and evolve constraints. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06427?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Schema Validation and Evolution for Graph Databases"))
        
    - **RDF world:** use **SHACL** shapes to validate instances against your ontology and to document conformance rules. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ "Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)"))
        

# 6) Identity & resolution (what is “the same thing”?)

- **Canonical IDs:** pick a **stable external key** where possible; attach alternates (aliases, emails, ticket IDs).
    
- **Merge policy:** encode dedup rules (exact keys + fuzzy match gates); store merges as events to keep audit trails.
    
- **Namespace strategy (RDF):** IRIs per namespace; optionally use **named graphs** for tenancy/versioning (if you go SPARQL/RDF datasets).
    

# 7) Labels, types, and directionality (PG ergonomics)

- **Write queries first:** Neo4j’s guidance is clear—design around your hot queries; keep **anchor** labels/properties indexed for fast starts. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-modeling/modeling-tips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Graph modeling tips - Getting Started - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
- **Relationship direction:** pick a canonical direction (and index accordingly); add inverse queries in Cypher rather than modelling both ways unless you truly need both.
    
- **Attribute vs node:** promote a property to a node when you (a) filter on it frequently across many entities, (b) need to attach **relationships** to it, or (c) need shared identity (e.g., “Region”, “Owner”).
    

# 8) Partitioning & multi-tenancy

- **By label/type (PG):** soft partitions with labels and security rules.
    
- **By dataset/named graph (RDF):** isolate tenants/versions as named graphs; validate each with SHACL shapes. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ "Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)"))
    

# 9) Modelling for global/corpus questions

- Even though “global” sits in indexing, **model hooks** help: keep **community membership** (cluster IDs) on entities, and store **summary/report** nodes/documents that can be refreshed on a schedule (Microsoft’s “community reports”). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/outputs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Outputs - GraphRAG"))
    

# 10) Multimodal attachments

- **Externalise blobs** (S3/Blob storage) and link via URI; keep **derived text** (OCR/ASR) as chunks tied to the same asset node for retrieval and citation.
    
- **Embed where you’ll retrieve:** GraphRAG lets you embed entities, relationships, chunks, and summaries—decide which fields you’ll actually search against. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/config/yaml/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Detailed Configuration - GraphRAG"))

## Quick “chooser” table

|Requirement|Recommended modelling choice|
|---|---|
|Fast multi-hop traversals, flexible schema|**Property Graph** with prescriptive labels & a few mandatory props; event/statement nodes for n-ary facts|
|Standards, validation, interop|**RDF** with ontology + **SHACL** shapes; use **OWL-Time** for temporal semantics|
|Many qualifiers per fact (who/when/where/source)|**Event/statement nodes** (PG) or **n-ary pattern** (RDF)|
|“As-of” and auditability|**Valid-time** on facts; for audit add **bi-temporal** (PG) or use **OWL-Time** in RDF and dataset snapshots|
|Strong provenance/citations|**TextUnit** nodes + edges from entities/claims to supporting chunks; preserve doc offsets and timestamps (GraphRAG model)|

## Minimal patterns to copy

- **Event as node (PG):**  
    `(Service)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(Dependency)` is fine; but for a change rollout use  
    `(Change {at: t, pr:"PR-123"})-[:AFFECTS]->(Service)` and link `(Change)-[:EVIDENCE]->(TextUnit)`. This supports temporal filters and grounded answers. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/default_dataflow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dataflow - GraphRAG"))
    
- **N-ary relation (RDF):**  
    Create an intermediate `:Participation` (or domain-specific) node per W3C n-ary pattern; attach role properties/links and time/provenance to that node. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/ "Defining N-ary Relations on the Semantic Web"))
    
- **Validation (RDF):**  
    Define SHACL **NodeShapes** and **PropertyShapes** for each class (cardinalities, datatypes, path constraints). Enforce in CI on ingest. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/ "Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)"))

## Common pitfalls (and how to dodge them)

- **Under-modelling time:** add valid-time from day one; otherwise “what was true then?” becomes expensive or impossible. Use **OWL-Time** terms if you’re in RDF. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/ "Time Ontology in OWL"))
    
- **Encoding n-ary facts as single edges:** you’ll quickly run out of room for qualifiers; switch to **event/statement nodes** early. ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/ "Defining N-ary Relations on the Semantic Web"))
    
- **Hard-coding everything as properties:** promote hot attributes to nodes when you need identity or fan-out queries (Neo4j’s modelling guides discuss query-driven design). ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-modeling/modeling-tips/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Graph modeling tips - Getting Started - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
- **Skipping provenance:** keep **TextUnits** and link every fact back to sources so generation can cite accurately (the GraphRAG model bakes this in). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/default_dataflow/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dataflow - GraphRAG"))

If you share your **target question classes** and a **draft entity list**, I’ll turn this into a concrete schema: node/edge types, required props, temporal fields, SHACL (if RDF) or PG constraints, plus a few Cypher/SPARQL examples to sanity-check the design.
