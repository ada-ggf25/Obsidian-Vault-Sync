Great question — the **“Create Vocabulary”** step is foundational when building a language model. Let me explain clearly what it is, **why it’s important**, and how it works with simple examples.

---

## 🧠 What Does “Create Vocabulary” Mean?

In the context of training a language model, **“creating a vocabulary”** means:

> Mapping every unique symbol (like a character, word, or token) in your dataset to a unique **numerical ID** that the model can work with.

Neural networks **don’t understand text** directly — they only work with numbers. So we need a way to convert text to numbers and back.

---

## 📖 Vocabulary Example (Character-Level)

Suppose you have a small dataset:

```text
"hi ha"
```

### ✂️ Step 1: Extract Unique Characters

From `"hi ha"` the characters are:

```python
chars = sorted(list(set("hi ha")))
# Output: [' ', 'a', 'h', 'i']
```

That means your model only ever sees these **4 characters**. This is your **vocabulary**.

---

### 🔢 Step 2: Create Mappings

We map each character to a unique ID.

```python
stoi = {' ': 0, 'a': 1, 'h': 2, 'i': 3}  # String to Integer
itos = {0: ' ', 1: 'a', 2: 'h', 3: 'i'}  # Integer to String
```

Now we can:

- Encode text as numbers (input to the model)
    
- Decode numbers back to text (model output)
    

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Encode Text into IDs

```python
text = "hi ha"
encoded = [stoi[c] for c in text]
# Output: [3, 2, 0, 2, 1]
```

Each character → number.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Decode Numbers into Text

```python
decoded = ''.join([itos[i] for i in encoded])
# Output: "hi ha"
```

---

## 🔠 Word-Level vs Character-Level vs Token-Level

|Type|Description|Example Input|Vocabulary Size|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Character**|Each char is a token|`"hello"` → `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`|Small (≈100)|
|**Word**|Each word is a token|`"hello world"` → `['hello', 'world']`|Large (10k–1M)|
|**Subword (BPE)**|Common sub-parts|`"unhappiness"` → `['un', 'happiness']`|Medium (~30k–50k)|

> Most large language models today use **subword tokenisation** like BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) or SentencePiece.

---

## 🧰 Tools for Automatic Tokenisation

If you don’t want to do this manually:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

text = "hi ha"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
# Output: [15339, 50118]  (token IDs)
decoded = tokenizer.decode(encoded)
```

---

## ✅ Summary

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Vocabulary**|All unique symbols your model can understand|
|**stoi / itos**|String ↔ Integer lookup for encoding/decoding|
|**Why it matters**|Models work with numbers — not raw text|
|**Manual or automatic**|You can build it yourself (char-level) or use Hugging Face tokenisers|
