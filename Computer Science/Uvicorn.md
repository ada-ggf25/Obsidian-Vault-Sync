[[FastAPI & Uvicorn]]
- [ ] [[UV Vs Uvicorn]]
[[Uvicorn Setup]]

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server implementation for Python. It serves as a bridge between asynchronous Python web applications and the network, handling HTTP and WebSocket protocols efficiently. Uvicorn is particularly well-suited for frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, and Django Channels, which are designed to leverage asynchronous capabilities.[Geekflare+14GeeksforGeeks+14Medium+14](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fastapi-uvicorn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia+3PyPI+3GitHub+3](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[uvicorn.org+1Reddit+1](https://www.uvicorn.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### üîß Key Features

- **ASGI Support**: Uvicorn implements the ASGI specification, enabling support for both synchronous and asynchronous Python applications. This allows for handling long-lived connections like WebSockets and background tasks, which are not feasible with traditional WSGI servers.[GeeksforGeeks+2Wikipedia+2GitHub+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Server_Gateway_Interface?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **High Performance**: When installed with optional dependencies (`uvicorn[standard]`), Uvicorn utilizes `uvloop` (a high-performance event loop) and `httptools` (a fast HTTP parser), enhancing its speed and efficiency. [uvicorn.org+6PyPI+6GitHub+6](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Lightweight and Minimal**: Designed with minimalism in mind, Uvicorn has a small footprint and is easy to integrate into projects without unnecessary overhead.
    
- **Protocol Support**: Supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket protocols out of the box, making it suitable for modern web applications requiring real-time communication.[uvicorn.org+3majisemi.com+3PyPI+3](https://majisemi.com/topics/oss/4004/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### üöÄ Getting Started

To install Uvicorn:

bash

CopiarEditar

`pip install uvicorn`

For enhanced performance with optional dependencies:

bash

CopiarEditar

`pip install "uvicorn[standard]"`

To run an ASGI application (e.g., a FastAPI app defined in `main.py` with an app instance named `app`):[Medium+14fastapi.tiangolo.com+14Django Project+14](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

bash

CopiarEditar

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloads on code changes, which is useful during development.[fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/manually/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Considerations

While Uvicorn is excellent for development and lightweight production scenarios, for more robust production deployments, it's common to pair Uvicorn with a process manager like Gunicorn. This combination allows for managing multiple worker processes, handling load balancing, and ensuring application resilience. For instance, using Uvicorn with Gunicorn can be achieved with:[Django Project+1uvicorn.org+1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/deployment/asgi/uvicorn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

bash

CopiarEditar

`gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker myproject.asgi:application`

This command starts Gunicorn with four worker processes using Uvicorn's worker class. [uvicorn.org](https://www.uvicorn.org/deployment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In summary, Uvicorn is a modern, high-performance web server tailored for asynchronous Python web applications, providing the necessary infrastructure to handle concurrent connections efficiently.
