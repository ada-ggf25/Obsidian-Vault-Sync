Here’s the clean mental model:

- **Wall time (“clock time”)** = how long the _calendar clock_ on the wall moves while your job runs.
    
    It includes **everything**: waiting for disk/network, waiting for other processes, queue time, Python overhead, sleeps, etc.
    
- **CPU time (“compute time”)** = how long the **CPU cores** were actually busy executing your job’s instructions.
    
    It **excludes** all waiting (I/O waits, sleeps, time when the process is paused). It sums per core.
    

### How they relate (with concrete scenarios)

1. **I/O-bound job** (e.g., `time.sleep(5)` or reading a big file)

- Wall ≈ **5 s**
- CPU ≈ **~0 s**
- Why: you’re mostly waiting, not computing.

1. **CPU-bound, single core** (tight numerical loop)

- Wall ≈ **2 s**
- CPU ≈ **~2 s**
- Why: one core is busy the whole time.

1. **CPU-bound, multi-core** (NumPy/BLAS uses 8 threads)

- Wall ≈ **2 s**
- CPU ≈ **~16 s**
- Why: 8 cores × ~2 s each → CPU time **can exceed** wall time because it’s the _sum across cores_.

1. **Mixed workload** (compute + fetching data over network)

- Wall > CPU
- The gap tells you how much time is lost to waiting.

### Why it matters

- Big **Wall >> CPU** → you’re **I/O-bound**. Optimize disk/network, batch requests, cache, use async I/O, or increase parallelism across I/O waits.
- **CPU ≈ Wall** (single core) → you’re **CPU-bound**. Optimize algorithms, use vectorization/NumPy, C/numba, or parallelize.
- **CPU >> Wall** → you’re successfully using multiple cores/threads.

### How to measure quickly

- **Linux/macOS `time`**:
    
    `real` = wall, `user + sys` ≈ CPU.
    
- **Python**:
    
    - `time.perf_counter()` → wall time
    - `time.process_time()` → CPU time (per process)
    - Profilers (e.g., `cProfile`, `py-spy`) show where CPU time is spent.

### One-liner intuition

Wall time = “how long you waited.”

CPU time = “how much CPU you actually _used_.”
