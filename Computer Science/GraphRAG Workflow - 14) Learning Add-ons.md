Heck yes—**Stage 14: Learning add-ons** is where you bolt ML onto GraphRAG so it _adapts_ to your domain, your users, and your data drift. Think: learned **representations**, **re-rankers**, **routers**, and **validators** that make the rest of your pipeline smarter.

Below is a pragmatic “menu” of learning components, **where they plug in**, and **how to train them**.

---

# 14.1 Representation learning for retrieval (what you index)

## A) Text bi-encoders you can fine-tune

- **Goal:** better top-k seeds for your corpus/domain.
    
- **How:** fine-tune a Sentence-Transformers model with **contrastive/triplet losses**, **in-batch negatives**, and **hard-negative mining**. These are the standard, well-documented recipes (with ready-made trainers & losses).
    
- **When to use:** your queries/doc style is niche (clinical, legal, internal jargon), or BM25/vector hybrids still miss obvious hits.
    

## B) Graph/structure-aware embeddings (nodes, edges, paths)

- **Inductive GNNs (general graphs):** learn node embeddings that generalise to unseen nodes/graphs; **GraphSAGE** is the classic baseline for this. Use its embeddings as a _second_ index or as features for reranking.
    
- **Shallow walks (fast, robust):** **node2vec** (biased random walks, good for homophily/structure trade-offs) for light-weight topology signals. Great for “ego-net similarity” seeds.
    
- **Heterogeneous graphs:** **metapath2vec**/**MetaGraph2Vec** to capture type-aware structure; use meta-paths or meta-graphs to steer random walks in KGs/HINs.
    
- **Hypergraphs:** **HyperSAGE** (GraphSAGE-style message passing on hyperedges) when relations are n-ary by nature (events/transactions).
    
- **Whole-graph embeddings:** **graph2vec** if you need to compare _graphs as objects_ (e.g., versioned subsystem graphs).
    
- **Knowledge-graph embeddings (link prediction):** e.g., **ComplEx** (strong for symmetric/antisymmetric relations). Use scores for candidate expansion and for scoring explanation paths.
    

**How this plugs in:**

- Build _extra_ ANN indexes: (a) text embeddings, (b) node embeddings, optionally (c) path/edge embeddings. Seed retrieval can union them; structure scores become features for downstream re-rankers.

# 14.2 Learned re-ranking & late interaction (what actually floats to the top)

## A) Cross-encoder / LLM re-rankers (precision lift)

- **What:** joint (query, candidate) models trained to score relevance (e.g., MS MARCO-style). Sentence-Transformers ships **cross-encoder loss functions** and training scaffolding.
    
- **Why:** biggest single bump in precision@k for passages/snippets, especially when your first-stage is recall-oriented.
    

## B) Late-interaction retrievers (flexible middle ground)

- **What:** **ColBERT** encodes query/doc separately, then does efficient _token-level_ similarity at search time—often near cross-encoder quality, but scalable enough for retrieval. Great as a re-ranker or even first-stage over big corpora.
    

**Training notes:**

- Start with a strong off-the-shelf cross-encoder → **distill** it into your bi-encoder/ColBERT to save latency. (Sentence-Transformers includes distillation examples.)
    
- Use **hard negatives** (BM25/topical near misses). Balance with **in-batch negatives** to avoid overfitting and false negatives.

# 14.3 Learning for graph-native retrieval (beyond text)

- **Node ranking for seed selection:** train a GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE) to predict “is this node helpful for this query class?” and use the score to bias neighbourhood traversals.
    
- **Path scoring:** learn a small model over path features (length, rel-types, timestamps, KGE scores) to prioritise _explanation paths_ during packaging; ComplEx or related KGE scores are informative features.
    
- **HIN meta-path priors:** mine/learn good meta-paths (or meta-graphs) per question type; metapath2vec/MetaGraph2Vec provide the walk mechanics you can supervise or weight.
    

---

# 14.4 Learning to **route/plan** (optional, but pays off)

- **Router classifiers:** predict _pipeline_ (Local/Global/DRIFT; template vs Text2Cypher) from the question. Train on labeled traces or heuristics-generated silver labels; cheap and effective.
    
- **(If you go agentic) value-guided step selection:** keep it simple—learn a “continue or stop” head + “which tool next” classifier from successful traces. (You can add fancier RL later; most teams don’t need it initially.)
    

_(I’m deliberately keeping this router bit model-light; it’s the least risky path to value.)_

---

# 14.5 Learning for **Text2Cypher** (structured queries)

- **What to learn:** a domain-conditioned Text2Cypher generator that respects your **sanitised schema view** and emits **read-only** queries (your gateway still validates/limits execution).
    
- **How to train:** schema-aware instruction-tuning (pairs of {question, schema snippet} → Cypher), then **hard-negative augmentation** with near-miss queries your linter would reject (to teach the model what _not_ to do).
    
- **Why it helps:** you get high recall on long-tail, structural questions without hand-coding every template.  
    _(Guardrails still do the heavy lifting; the “learning” is just to cut false starts.)_

# 14.6 Where each add-on slots into your pipeline

1. **Indexing time**
    
    - Train/refresh **text bi-encoders** and **graph embeddings** → (re)build ANN indexes.
        
2. **First-stage retrieval**
    
    - Hybrid seed: BM25 + text-embed + (optional) node-embed → fuse.
        
3. **Graph expansion**
    
    - Use learned **node/path scores** to cap hops and prioritise good evidence.
        
4. **Re-ranking**
    
    - Apply **cross-encoder** or **ColBERT**; optionally distill to speed up.
        
5. **Packaging**
    
    - Keep top-k snippets + high-score paths; attach KGE scores as features.

# 14.7 Minimal training recipes (copy/paste strategy)

- **Text bi-encoder (domain-adapt):**  
    Start from a strong ST model → train with **MultipleNegativesRanking** or **Triplet** loss + **in-batch negatives**; mine **hard negatives** weekly from your own search logs.
    
- **Graph node embeddings (inductive):**  
    GraphSAGE on your property graph (input: node features; labels optional). Export embeddings to a node-index; use as a parallel seed/rerank feature.
    
- **HIN/hypergraph (if applicable):**  
    Train **metapath2vec/MetaGraph2Vec** or **HyperSAGE**; index those vectors to enable “structural similarity” retrieval.
    
- **Re-ranker:**  
    Fine-tune a **cross-encoder** (BCE/CrossEntropy) on (query, passage, label). If latency matters, train **ColBERT** and/or **distill** from the cross-encoder.
    

---

# 14.8 What to measure while you iterate

- **Retrieval:** recall@k / nDCG across archetypes; **Context Precision/Recall** on the final pack.
    
- **Re-ranker lift:** Δprecision@k and groundedness at the same token budget.
    
- **Ablations:** text-only vs text+graph embeddings; cross-encoder vs ColBERT.
    
- **Cost:** added latency and GPU time per request; make sure lifts justify spend.
    

---

## TL;DR picks

- If you only do **one** thing: **fine-tune a text bi-encoder** with in-batch + hard negatives. It’s cheap and moves the needle.
    
- If you can do **two**: add a **cross-encoder re-ranker** (or **ColBERT** if you need more throughput).
    
- If your graph topology matters: **GraphSAGE/node2vec** embeddings as a _second_ signal (and features for path scoring).
    
- HIN/hypergraph? **metapath2vec/MetaGraph2Vec** or **HyperSAGE**.
    
- Need KG reasoning signals? add a **ComplEx** scorer for link plausibility on candidate paths.

If you tell me your **domain**, **latency budget**, and **where retrieval fails today** (misses vs wrong-order), I’ll propose a concrete add-on plan (which encoder to fine-tune, loss & negatives, whether to add ColBERT, and whether to train GraphSAGE/metapath2vec) with a 2-week training/eval schedule.
