[[Tensorflow VS Numpy]]
[[TensorFlow & Scaler]]

I have this:

X_Tensor = np.expand_dims(X_combined, axis=0)

Should I run this code after or not:

X_Tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(X_Tensor)

To run:

predictions = model.predict(X_Tensor)

### ChatGPT said:

You don’t need to call `tf.convert_to_tensor` yourself here – Keras’ `model.predict(...)` will accept a NumPy array just fine. In fact, once you’ve done

```python
python
CopyEdit
X_Tensor = np.expand_dims(X_combined, axis=0)

```

you can go straight to

```python
python
CopyEdit
predictions = model.predict(X_Tensor)

```

under TensorFlow 2.x (where eager execution is on by default).

Behind the scenes, Keras will convert your NumPy array into the right tensor form (and on to the GPU if you’ve one configured) automatically. The only time you’d need to manually call `tf.convert_to_tensor` is if you really wanted to force a specific TensorFlow dtype or tensor placement before feeding into some lower‑level TF API – but not for a standard `model.predict` call.
