## ðŸ“¬ Core API: Messages Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`

**Required Headers:**

- `x-api-key`: Your API key
    
- `anthropic-version`: API version (e.g., `2023-06-01`)
    
- `content-type`: `application/json`
    

**Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "model": "claude-4-opus-20250522",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum entanglement."}
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

- Returns a JSON object with the assistant's reply.
    

**Features:**

- Supports alternating `user` and `assistant` messages.
    
- Handles multimodal inputs (text and images) with compatible models.
    
- Allows tool use and function calling for enhanced capabilities.

## ðŸ§° Advanced Features

### 1. **Tool Use**

- Enable Claude to interact with external tools or APIs.
    
- Define tools in the request, and Claude can decide when to invoke them.
    

### 2. **Message Batches API**

- Process large volumes of messages asynchronously.
    
- Useful for tasks like summarizing multiple documents or handling bulk queries.
    

### 3. **Files API**

- Upload and manage files (e.g., PDFs) for Claude to reference.
    
- Facilitates tasks like document analysis and extraction. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/learn/build-with-claude?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic Academy: Claude API Development Guide"))
    

### 4. **Admin API**

- Programmatically manage your organization's resources.
    
- Includes functionalities like user management and usage tracking.
    

### 5. **Prompt Caching**
