You’re seeing how **NumPy slices create _views_** (references to the same memory) rather than independent copies.

## What the code does

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

s = a[2:3, 1:3]
print(s)     # -> [[8 9]]

```

- `a` is a 3×3 array.
- `a[2:3, 1:3]` means: take **rows 2..2** (just row index 2) and **cols 1..2** (indices 1 and 2).
- So `s` is a **1×2 window** that _points into_ `a` (the elements 8 and 9).
- Because it’s a **slice**, `s` is a **view**: it shares the **same underlying data buffer** as `a`.

Then:

```python
s[:, :] = -2
print("s", s)
print("a", a)

```

- `s[:, :] = -2` assigns `2` to every element of `s`.
    
    `[:, :]` just means “all rows, all columns” of `s` (broadcast a scalar).
    
- Since `s` is a **view**, this write goes **into the same memory** as `a`, so the corresponding region of `a` changes.
    

Result:

```
s [[-2 -2]]

a [[ 1  2  3]
   [ 4  5  6]
   [ 7 -2 -2]]

```

Only the bottom-right 1×2 block of `a` (which `s` references) is modified.

## Key takeaways

- **Basic slicing** (`:` with steps, like `a[2:3, 1:3]`, `a[::-1]`, etc.) → **view** (no copy).
    
    Changes through the view reflect in the original array.
    
- **Fancy/advanced indexing** (lists/arrays/boolean masks, e.g. `a[[0,2], [1,2]]` or `a[a>5]`) → **copy** (usually).
    
- To force a **copy** from a slice, call `.copy()`:
    
    ```python
    s = a[2:3, 1:3].copy()  # independent data
    s[:, :] = -2            # now a will NOT change
    
    ```

## Mental model (visual)

```
a memory (3x3):
[ [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9] ]
          ^^^^^^
          view s (row 2, cols 1..2) -> [[8, 9]]

```

Writing via `s` writes into that highlighted region of `a`.

---

## Extra: shapes and strides (why this works fast)

- `s.shape == (1, 2)` — a “window” into `a`.
- Slices don’t move data; they adjust **offsets/strides** to point into `a`’s buffer. That’s why views are **zero-copy** and fast.

If you want, I can show quick variations (e.g., vertical/horizontal slices, reversed views, and a fancy indexing example) to contrast view vs copy.

Short answer: **no**—plain Python containers don’t behave like NumPy here.

- **Lists, tuples, strings, array.array, etc.:** `seq[i:j:k]` makes a **new object (a shallow copy)**. Rebinding or assigning into that sliced result won’t affect the original.
    
    ```python
    a = [1,2,3,4]
    s = a[1:3]        # [2,3]  <-- new list
    s[0] = 99
    print(a)          # [1,2,3,4]  (unchanged)
    
    ```
    
- **Shallow copy caveat (nested mutables):** the slice copies **references**. If elements are mutable and you mutate **the element itself**, the original reflects it because both lists point to the same inner object.
    
    ```python
    a = [[1,2],[3,4]]
    s = a[1:2]        # [[3,4]]  (new outer list, same inner list object)
    s[0][0] = 99
    print(a)          # [[1,2],[99,4]]  (inner list was mutated)
    
    ```
    
- **Slice assignment modifies the original:** writing to a slice of the original changes it.
    
    ```python
    a = [1,2,3,4]
    a[1:3] = [20,30]
    print(a)          # [1,20,30,4]
    
    ```
    
- **View-like behavior in pure Python:** only for **bytes-like** data using `memoryview` (and some buffers). That gives a true **view** without copying.
    
    ```python
    b = bytearray(b"abcd")
    v = memoryview(b)[1:3]
    v[:] = b"XY"
    print(b)          # bytearray(b'aXYd')
    
    ```
    

NumPy is special: **basic slicing returns a view** (no copy), which is why changing the slice changes the original array’s region.
