Great question — they’re related but not the same thing.
# TL;DR

- **Dynamic Cypher (a.k.a. Text2Cypher)** = _one-shot query generation_. The LLM turns your natural-language question into a **single Cypher query** against a known graph schema, executes it, and returns the results.
    
- **Agentic Traversal** = _multi-step tool use_. The LLM **plans and iterates**, choosing among multiple retrievers (vector search, path/neighborhood traversals, query templates, **and possibly Text2Cypher**) until it has enough evidence to answer.
    

Think of **Text2Cypher** as _a tool_, and **Agentic Traversal** as _a planner that can choose and chain tools_.

# What each does

## Dynamic Cypher / Text2Cypher

- **How it works:**
    
    1. LLM reads your question + a sanitized graph schema.
        
    2. Generates a **single Cypher** query (sometimes parameterised).
        
    3. Runs it and returns rows/records (optionally post-processed).
        
- **Best for:** precise, schema-aligned asks: “Who owns Service X?”, “Incidents involving Service X in the last 7 days”, “Shortest path between A and B”.
    
- **Pros:** low latency; deterministic/explainable; easy to audit; great with governed KGs.
    
- **Cons / gotchas:** query-hallucination or injection risks; brittle if schema context is incomplete; not great when the question is fuzzy or needs multi-hop evidence gathering across different modalities.
    

**Typical guardrails:** read-only role, allow-listed clauses, strict schema prompt, parameterised queries, time/row limits, and a validator that rejects unsafe Cypher.

## Agentic Traversal

- **How it works:**  
    The LLM acts as a **controller**: it plans → calls a retriever → inspects results → decides the next step. Tools might include:
    
    - vector/full-text seed search,
        
    - neighborhood or path traversals,
        
    - **Text2Cypher**,
        
    - query templates,
        
    - global/community summaries.  
        It loops until a stop condition (enough evidence, step/latency budget).
        
- **Best for:** ambiguous or **multi-step** questions: “Why did Service A’s latency spike last week?”, “How is vendor B implicated in outages affecting region EU-West?”.
    
- **Pros:** flexible; can combine multiple evidence types; better recall on messy asks.
    
- **Cons / gotchas:** higher latency/cost; non-deterministic plans; needs budgets (max steps/tools), and solid tool selection/reranking to avoid loops.
    

**Common patterns:** ReAct-style “think-act-observe”, tool selection with function-calling, per-step re-ranking, caching, and final answer synthesis with citations.

# When to use which

Use **Text2Cypher** when:

- You have a well-defined **schema** and governed data.
    
- The question maps cleanly to a **single query**.
    
- You need **speed, auditability,** and consistent outputs.
    

Use **Agentic Traversal** when:

- The ask is open-ended or **multi-hop**.
    
- You must **mix** graph queries with vector search, path expansion, and summaries.
    
- You can afford a bit more latency for **better recall** and reasoning.

# Quick examples

**Text2Cypher (one-shot):**  
“_List P1 incidents for Service A in the last 7 days with owners._”  
→ Generate Cypher using the `Incident`, `Service`, `OWNS` schema → run → return table.

**Agentic Traversal (multi-step):**  
“_Why did Service A’s latency spike last week?_”

1. Vector search for logs/incidents mentioning “latency spike” + Service A.
    
2. Neighborhood traversal around `Service A` for recent `DEPENDS_ON` changes.
    
3. Path traversal `A → DEPENDS_ON → B → had_change(PR-123)` in time window.
    
4. **Text2Cypher** to aggregate “incidents by component and time”.
    
5. Synthesis: “Spike correlates with change PR-123 on dependency B; rollback reduced p95.”

# Relationship in one line

**Agentic Traversal often _uses_ Text2Cypher as one of its tools.** Text2Cypher answers a structured sub-question; the agent decides _when_ to call it and _what to do next_ with the result.

If you want, I can sketch a minimal **Neo4j + Text2Cypher** snippet and an **agentic** flow (with step limits and guardrails) tailored to your internship_GraphRAG stack.

_Note:_ I tried to pull in live references for Neo4j Text2Cypher and agentic RAG docs just now, but my browsing tool is erroring. If you share a link you’re reading (e.g., the Neo4j Field Guide page), I’ll attach precise citations and any implementation gotchas they call out.
