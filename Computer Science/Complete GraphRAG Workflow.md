## Main Differences

1. **Graph Structure**
    
    - **Standard GraphRAG** uses simple node-edge knowledge graphs extracted from text ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/genai/what-is-graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is GraphRAG?")).
        
    - **HyperGraphRAG** replaces edges with hyperedges to model n-ary relations, enabling richer relational semantics ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21322?utm_source=chatgpt.com "HyperGraphRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hypergraph-Structured Knowledge Representation")).
        
    - **T-GRAG** augments graphs with timestamps, capturing the evolution of knowledge over time ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01680?utm_source=chatgpt.com "T-GRAG: A Dynamic GraphRAG Framework for Resolving Temporal Conflicts and Redundancy in Knowledge Retrieval")).
        
2. **Retrieval Mechanism**
    
    - **Template-based and Cypher-driven** patterns in Standard GraphRAG focus on pre-written graph queries and post-processing ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/graphrag-field-guide-rag-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GraphRAG Field Guide: Navigating the World of Advanced ...")).
        
    - **Graph Neural Networks** in GFM-RAG learn embeddings and retrieval strategies end-to-end on large-scale graph data ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation")).
        
    - **U-Retrieval** in MedGraphRAG balances global context with precise indexing for medical QA ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04187?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Medical Graph RAG: Towards Safe Medical Large Language Model via Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation")).
        
3. **Domain Specialization**
    
    - **MedGraphRAG** is explicitly designed for evidence-based medical responses, emphasizing safety and credibility ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04187?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Medical Graph RAG: Towards Safe Medical Large Language Model via Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation")).
        
    - **GFM-RAG** and **HyperGraphRAG** aim for broad applicability across domains by improving generalizability or modeling capabilities ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation")).
        
    - **T-GRAG** addresses temporal reasoning, making it ideal for financial, legal, or historical QA where timeliness matters ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01680?utm_source=chatgpt.com "T-GRAG: A Dynamic GraphRAG Framework for Resolving Temporal Conflicts and Redundancy in Knowledge Retrieval")).
        
4. **Modeling Complexity**
    
    - **HyperGraphRAG** increases modeling complexity to handle n-ary relations, at the cost of more intricate graph construction and retrieval pipelines ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21322?utm_source=chatgpt.com "HyperGraphRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hypergraph-Structured Knowledge Representation")).
        
    - **Standard GraphRAG** remains simpler, relying on existing graph databases and vector fallbacks for broad coverage ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/improving-retrieval-augmented-generation-accuracy-with-graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Retrieval Augmented Generation accuracy with ...")).
        
    - **GFM-RAG** introduces an additional model training phase but simplifies downstream application by eliminating fine-tuning needs ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation")).

You’ve got it right: those “axes” are the backbone of a **complete GraphRAG workflow**, but a production system usually has a few more stages wrapped around them (ingestion, indexing, ranking, generation, evals, ops, etc.).

Below is a **practical end-to-end blueprint**. For **each stage** I list the **common approaches** (with quick notes on when to choose them). I’m not dumping theory—you’ll get the menu you can actually build from.

> Heads-up: I tried to fetch live refs to attach, but my browsing tool is glitching right now. I’ll plug in high-quality sources (Microsoft GraphRAG docs, Neo4j Field Guide, AWS blog, LightRAG, etc.) as soon as it’s back. For now, here’s the full plan.

---

# 0) Problem Framing & Data Scoping (often skipped, don’t)

**Decide what “good” means** before you pick tech.

- **Question classes**: lookup, relationship (“how is A related to B?”), root-cause, summarisation, trends/temporal.
    
- **Constraints**: latency budget, cost cap, privacy/RBAC, schema governance, citation requirements.
    
- **Freshness**: static corpus vs. streaming updates; rebuild cadence for summaries/embeddings.
    

---

# 1) Knowledge Modelling (Graph Structure axis)

How you represent knowledge drives everything downstream.

## 1.1 Property Graph (mainstream; Neo4j, Neptune PG)

- **Approaches**:
    
    - **Schema-first** (explicit node/edge labels + properties)
        
    - **Schema-light** (start loose, tighten with migrations)
        
    - **Ontology-guided** (import domain model, e.g., a data catalog’s entities)
        
- **When**: general enterprise, incident/asset graphs, people/places/things.
    

## 1.2 RDF / Triplestore (SPARQL, named graphs)

- **Approaches**:
    
    - OWL/RDFS ontologies, SHACL constraints
        
    - Named graphs for versioning/tenancy
        
- **When**: need standards, interop, reasoning rules.
    

## 1.3 Temporal Graphs

- **Approaches**:
    
    - **Valid-time on edges/nodes** (from/to timestamps)
        
    - **Snapshotting** (daily/weekly graph snapshots)
        
    - **Bi-temporal** (valid time + transaction time)
        
- **When**: finance, legal, compliance, “as of” queries.
    

## 1.4 Hypergraphs / n-ary events

- **Approaches**:
    
    - True hypergraph DB (rare)
        
    - **Event-as-node in property graph** (model an event node linked to all participants; pragmatic and common)
        
- **When**: many-participant events (trades, supply-chain, clinical events).
    

## 1.5 Multimodal attachments

- **Approaches**:
    
    - Store blobs externally; link via URIs
        
    - Extract **doc chunks** as child nodes with embeddings
        
- **When**: you need both structure **and** rich text grounding.
    

---

# 2) Ingestion & Graph Construction

Turn raw sources into a governed graph.

## 2.1 Extraction

- **Pattern-based**: regex/rules, SQL joins, ETL mappings (stable/cheap).
    
- **NLP pipelines**: NER + relation extraction (spaCy/transformers).
    
- **LLM-assisted IE**: prompt LLMs to emit triples/events; add **self-check** or **dual LLM** validation; human review for high stakes.
    
- **Log/event ingestion**: stream CDC, audit logs, CI/CD events; build event nodes.
    

## 2.2 Entity Resolution & Canonicalisation

- **Heuristic matching** (keys, emails, IDs)
    
- **Embedding similarity + rules**
    
- **Graph-aware disambiguation** (context from neighbours)
    

## 2.3 Governance & Quality

- **Constraints** (unique keys, SHACL)
    
- **Lineage** (source doc IDs + offsets)
    
- **PII handling** (redaction, tokenisation)
    
- **RBAC** (labels/graph sub-partitions)
    

---

# 3) Indexing (you’ll use several)

Make retrieval fast and flexible.

- **Vector index** (embeddings for docs/nodes/ego-nets): HNSW/FAISS.
    
- **Full-text index**: BM25/keyword; great recall, cheap.
    
- **Graph native indexes**: label/property indexes; relationship indexes for traversal.
    
- **Composite**: per type (Incident, Service, Person), time-partitioned indexes.
    
- **Global structures**:
    
    - **Communities** (Louvain/Leiden) + **community summaries** (aka Microsoft “global” layer)
        
    - **Motif/metapath catalogues** (common path shapes)
        
    - **Path caches** (shortest paths between hot entities)
        

---

# 4) Retrieval (Retriever Strategy axis)

Mix-and-match depending on the question.

## 4.1 Seed finders

- **Vector search** (semantic)
    
- **Full-text** (exact keywords, filters)
    
- **Structured filters** (time windows, types)
    

## 4.2 Traversals

- **Neighbourhood (k-hop)** with **degree/type caps**
    
- **Path finding** (shortest, all simple paths with bounds)
    
- **Motif / metapath queries** (e.g., Service→DependsOn→Service→Incident)
    
- **Temporal traversals** (“as of T”, windowed hops)
    

## 4.3 Querying paradigms

- **Query templates** (hand-curated Cypher/SPARQL for common asks)
    
- **Dynamic Cypher (Text2Cypher)**
    
    - Provide **schema doc**/**allow-list**; generate **read-only** queries; validate/execute.
        
- **Programmatic Cypher/SPARQL** from application code (deterministic critical paths)
    

## 4.4 Global/corpus-level

- **Community summaries** (topic/theme overviews)
    
- **Query-Focused Summarisation (QFS)** over community subgraphs
    
- **Aggregations** (roll-ups by time, owner, severity)
    

## 4.5 Graph-embedding retrievers

- **Node/ego-net embeddings** (GraphSAGE, Node2Vec, GAT variants)
    
- **Hybrid score fusion**: structural sim + text sim
    

---

# 5) Orchestration & Planning (Agentic or not)

How the system _decides_ which retrievers to run and in what order.

## 5.1 Deterministic pipelines

- **Routing by question type** → fixed sequence of tools
    
- **Advantages**: predictable latency, easy to test/compliance
    
- **Use**: support flows, dashboards, governed reports
    

## 5.2 Agentic traversal (planner/controller)

- **ReAct-style loop**: plan → call tool → observe → iterate
    
- **Tools**: seed search, traversal, templates, **Text2Cypher**, global summaries
    
- **Guardrails**: step/latency budgets, tool allow-list, early-exit heuristics
    
- **Use**: ambiguous, multi-step investigations (RCA, threat intel)
    

## 5.3 Tool selection policies

- **Static** (regex/router)
    
- **Embedding router** (semantic classifier)
    
- **Learned** (bandit/RL on historical success/latency)
    

---

# 6) Fusion, Re-ranking, and Evidence Packaging

What you send to the LLM matters as much as what you found.

- **De-duplication** (near-duplicate chunks, same path twice)
    
- **Re-ranking**:
    
    - **BM25/embedding score fusion** (RRF)
        
    - **Cross-encoder rerankers** (e.g., monoT5-style; costlier but strong)
        
    - **Structure-aware rerank** (boost paths that satisfy motifs)
        
- **Diversity control (MMR)** to avoid redundant context
    
- **Attribution bundle**: keep **provenance** (node IDs, edge lists, doc offsets) with each snippet
    
- **Context shaping**:
    
    - **Graph-aware context windows** (group by entity/path)
        
    - **Chain-of-evidence** ordering (from direct facts → supporting docs)
        

---

# 7) Generation & Grounding

How the answer is written and justified.

- **Prompting patterns**:
    
    - **Grounded generation** (answer only from provided evidence)
        
    - **Citations inline** with node/doc IDs and timestamps
        
    - **Answer + appendix** (tables/paths)
        
- **Constrained decoding**:
    
    - JSON schemas, function-calling for structured outputs
        
    - “No new facts not in evidence” system rules
        
- **Multi-pass**:
    
    - Draft → **fact-check** pass (retrieve to verify risky claims)
        
    - **Self-consistency** (n→1 voting) for critical answers
        

---

# 8) Temporal Freshness & Drift Control

Avoid “yesterday’s truth”.

- **Incremental updates**: CDC streams to upsert nodes/edges
    
- **Summary refresh**: schedule community/global summary rebuilds
    
- **Time-aware retrieval defaults**: prefer last N days unless query specifies “as of”
    
- **Conflict resolution**: if facts differ across time, pick **valid-time closest** to the ask and display both when relevant
    

---

# 9) Security, Safety, and Guardrails

Especially important with **Text2Cypher** and agent tools.

- **DB roles**: read-only, limited graph segments
    
- **Query sandbox**: forbid writes, limits on rows/time, parameterised queries
    
- **Prompt hardening**: schema context only, no secrets in system prompts
    
- **PII policy**: redact/mask in prompts; field-level permissions
    
- **Tool allow-list**: agent can only call approved retrievers
    

---

# 10) Evaluation & QA (don’t ship without this)

Measure both retrieval and answers.

- **Retrieval**:
    
    - Recall@k / Hit@k vs. labelled gold
        
    - Path correctness vs. gold motifs
        
    - Freshness hit rates (temporal)
        
- **Generation**:
    
    - **Faithfulness/groundedness** scores (e.g., citation support)
        
    - Task-specific accuracy (exact match / F1 for structured asks)
        
    - Human rated coherence/usefulness
        
- **Frameworks/ops**:
    
    - Golden sets & shadow traffic
        
    - Per-question-class dashboards
        
    - Regression tests for Text2Cypher/templates
        

---

# 11) Performance & Cost Engineering

Keep it fast and affordable.

- **Budgets**: max tokens, max steps, max tools
    
- **Caching**: query → result, path cache, summary cache
    
- **Progressive retrieval**: start small (k, hops), expand if needed
    
- **Index sharding**: per entity type/time window
    
- **Batching**: embed/summarise in jobs; warmup caches for hot entities
    

---

# 12) Observability & Feedback

So you can improve it continuously.

- **Traces**: every tool call, query text, timing, token costs
    
- **Provenance logs**: which nodes/edges fed each answer
    
- **User feedback**: thumbs + “missing/incorrect” tags
    
- **Auto-triage**: route low-confidence answers for human review
    

---

# 13) Domain Specialisation (Domain axis)

Same mechanics, domain-specific glue.

- **Schemas/ontologies**: e.g., services/incidents/changes; patients/diagnoses/procedures; financial instruments/corporates/events.
    
- **Source curation**: trusted docs, policy repositories, EHR extracts, filings
    
- **Policy**: safety filters, terminology normalisation, disclaimers
    
- **Evaluations**: domain-specific gold sets and metrics
    

---

# 14) Learning Add-ons (Learning axis)

Where ML/GNNs add lift.

- **Graph embeddings**: Node2Vec/GraphSAGE/GAT for structure-aware retrieval
    
- **Cross-encoder rerankers**: fine-tuned on your Q→evidence pairs
    
- **Reasoning controllers**: learn which tool to call when (bandits/RL)
    
- **IE improvement loops**: label errors, re-train entity/relation extractors
    
- **Hallucination detectors**: classifiers scoring faithfulness
    

---

# Putting it together (an example plan for your incident domain)

1. **Model** a property graph: `Service`, `Incident`, `Change`, `Owner`, with time-stamped edges; include **Event** nodes for deployments.
    
2. **Ingest** tickets/logs/CMDB; do **LLM-assisted triples** + **entity resolution** (service names are messy).
    
3. **Index**: vector for incident text and change summaries; full-text for logs; graph indexes on `(Service.name)`, `(Incident.severity)`.
    
4. **Global**: detect communities by system/component; **summarise** each community and per-month incident themes.
    
5. **Retrieval**:
    
    - seed with vector or template (depending on ask)
        
    - 1–2 hop neighbourhood with type/degree caps
        
    - temporal filter to the user’s window
        
    - optional **Text2Cypher** for structured aggregates
        
6. **Fusion**: cross-encoder rerank; MMR; dedupe similar incident snippets.
    
7. **Generate**: grounded answer with **inline citations** (node IDs + timestamps).
    
8. **Evaluate**: gold RCA cases; monitor faithfulness; fix low-recall templates.
    
9. **Ops**: caching, budgets, read-only roles; refresh global summaries nightly.
    

---

## Quick chooser (what to pick when)

- **Simple lookup over a governed KG** → **Query templates** or **Text2Cypher** (fast, auditable).
    
- **“How are A and B connected?”** → **Path traversal** + small **neighbourhood** context; present the path.
    
- **“Why did X happen last week?”** → **Agentic**: seed (vector) → neighbourhood → temporal path over `Change`/`Incident` → one **Text2Cypher** aggregate → synthesis.
    
- **Corpus-wide trends** → **Global/community summaries** + date roll-ups; refresh on a schedule.
    
- **Messy data or thin KG** → **Hybrid graph + vector** with fallback to text chunks; add structure over time.
    

---

If you want, tell me:

- your **schema draft** (entities/edges + must-have properties),
    
- **latency/cost** targets,
    
- and **question classes** you care about,
    

and I’ll turn this into a concrete, repo-ready design (Cypher templates, Text2Cypher guardrails, retriever chain, and eval plan). Once my browser behaves again, I’ll attach the exact references (MS GraphRAG local/global, Neo4j’s retriever catalog, AWS GraphRAG patterns, LightRAG, etc.) to each stage.
