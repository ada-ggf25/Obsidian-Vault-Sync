It is better to use numpy to do this:

X_Tensor = np.expand_dims(X_combined, axis=0)

or to use Tensorlow?

## Summary

Both `np.expand_dims` and `tf.expand_dims` do the same basic job—insert a new axis of length 1 at a specified position—but you’ll choose between them based on the type of object you’re working with and where you want that operation to happen:

- **Use `np.expand_dims` (NumPy)** when your data already lives as a NumPy array and you’re preparing it for a one‑off call such as `model.predict(...)` in Keras. NumPy is simple and incurs no graph overhead [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Use `tf.expand_dims` (TensorFlow)** when your data is already a TensorFlow tensor (for example inside a `tf.data` pipeline, a `@tf.function`, or any low‑level TF API). That way the dimension change happens in the graph (and can stay on GPU/TPU) without round‑trip conversion [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/expand_dims?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Performance note:** Tensors can be executed on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) and benefit from graph optimizations, whereas NumPy arrays live on the CPU only [dev.mrdbourke.com](https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/00_tensorflow_fundamentals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 1. Using NumPy’s `expand_dims`

```python
python
CopyEdit
import numpy as np

# X_combined is a NumPy array of shape (batch_size, ..., features)
X_tfm = np.expand_dims(X_combined, axis=0)
# e.g. transforms shape from (32, 128) to (1, 32, 128)

```

- **When to use:**
    - Your data is already in NumPy format.
    - You’re about to call a NumPy‑friendly API (like `model.predict` on a Keras model).
- **Pros:**
    - Simple, no TensorFlow graph overhead.
    - Works out‑of‑the‑box with any NumPy‑based code.
- **Reference:**
    - NumPy docs: `numpy.expand_dims` [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 2. Using TensorFlow’s `expand_dims`

```python
python
CopyEdit
import tensorflow as tf

# X_combined is a tf.Tensor of shape (batch_size, ..., features)
X_tf   = tf.expand_dims(X_combined, axis=0)
# e.g. transforms shape from (32, 128) to (1, 32, 128)

```

- **When to use:**
    - Your data is already a `tf.Tensor` (e.g. within `tf.data.Dataset`, inside `@tf.function`, or other TF ops).
    - You want the expansion to occur in‑graph, so that it can stay on the GPU/TPU and be fused/optimized with other ops.
- **Pros:**
    - No implicit NumPy ↔ TensorFlow conversion.
    - Fully integrates with TF’s execution engine and accelerator support.
- **Reference:**
    - TensorFlow API: `tf.expand_dims` [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/expand_dims?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 3. Choosing Between Them

|Scenario|Use NumPy (`np.expand_dims`)|Use TensorFlow (`tf.expand_dims`)|
|---|---|---|
|**Standalone preprocessing** before a single `model.predict` call|✔ Prepares batches on the CPU||
|**Inside a `tf.data` pipeline** or `@tf.function` graph||✔ Keeps operations in‑graph and on accelerator|
|**Interoperability with other NumPy code**|✔ Seamless NumPy array support||
|**Performance on GPU/TPU**||✔ Graph optimizations & accelerator support|

In your original example—where you have a NumPy array and you’ll immediately call `model.predict`—`np.expand_dims` is perfectly fine and incurs no extra overhead. If instead you were building a `tf.data.Dataset` or doing transformations inside TensorFlow functions, prefer `tf.expand_dims`.
