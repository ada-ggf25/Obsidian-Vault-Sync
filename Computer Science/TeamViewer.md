When you use **TeamViewer** to remotely access another computer, the **remote PC**‚Äîfor example, your home computer in Lisbon‚Äîis the one actually running the programs and performing tasks. Your local device, such as a laptop in London, acts as a controller, sending keyboard and mouse inputs and displaying the remote screen.

### üñ•Ô∏è How TeamViewer Remote Control Works

- **Program Execution**: Applications run on the remote PC. For instance, if you open a video editor or a spreadsheet, it's processed by the remote machine's CPU and memory.
- **Display and Input**: The remote PC's screen is streamed to your local device, allowing you to see what's happening in real-time. Your keyboard strokes and mouse movements are sent to the remote PC, enabling you to interact with it as if you were physically present.
- **File Transfers**: TeamViewer supports secure file transfers between the local and remote machines. You can upload or download files as needed during a session.

### üîÑ Summary

In essence, TeamViewer allows you to **control** a remote computer, but all processing and program execution occur on the **remote machine**. Your local device serves as an interface to interact with the remote system.
