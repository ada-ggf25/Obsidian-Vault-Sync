### üßπ 1. Clean Up Temporary and System Files

**Disk Cleanup Utility:**

- **Basic Cleanup:**
    
    ```
    cmd
    CopyEdit
    cleanmgr
    
    ```
    

This opens the Disk Cleanup tool, allowing you to select and delete unnecessary files.

- **Advanced Cleanup with Preset Options:**
    
    ```
    cmd
    CopyEdit
    cleanmgr /sageset:1
    cleanmgr /sagerun:1
    
    ```
    

The first command lets you choose cleanup options to save under the preset '1'. The second command runs the cleanup using those saved settings.

**Manual Deletion of Temporary Files:**

```
cmd
CopyEdit
del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\*
del /q/f/s C:\\Windows\\Temp\\*

```

These commands delete files from temporary directories. Some files in use may not be deleted.

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Repair System Files

**System File Checker (SFC):**

```
cmd

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

```

Repairs the system image, which can help resolve issues that SFC cannot fix.
