[[Deleting GitHub Brunchs]]

Why does the new bruch that I created on Github does not appear on VS?

### ChatGPT said:

If the new branch you created on GitHub isn't showing up in VS Code (or Visual Studio), it's likely due to one of these common reasons. Here’s a checklist to help you debug and fix it:

---

### ✅ 1. **Did you fetch the new branch?**

VS Code (or Git in general) won’t automatically know about new remote branches until you fetch them.

**Fix:** Open the terminal in VS Code and run:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git fetch

```

After that, try checking out the branch:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git checkout branch-name

```

---

### ✅ 2. **Check if the branch exists remotely**

Sometimes the branch might not have been pushed to the remote correctly.

**Fix:** Run:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git branch -r

```

This will list all remote branches. If you don’t see your new branch there, it hasn’t been pushed from GitHub or another contributor.

---

### ✅ 3. **Pull and switch using VS Code UI**

In the bottom left of VS Code, you’ll see the current branch. Click it, and it should show a list of local and remote branches. If it’s remote-only, click it and it’ll create a local tracking branch.

---

### ✅ 4. **Check if you’re connected to the right repo**

Make sure you're in the correct directory, and that your repo is connected to the GitHub repository where you created the branch.

Run:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
git remote -v

```

And verify it points to the expected GitHub repo.
