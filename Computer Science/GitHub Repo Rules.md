If I am making a big repo on github how many requeriments.txt files should the repo have?

### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds

A “requirements.txt” file isn’t a global property of a GitHub repo so much as it’s a property of each independent Python project or environment within your repo. In practice:

- **One per project/service**: If your repo contains multiple Python projects (e.g. a web service, a batch job, a library), each should have its own `requirements.txt` (often in its own subdirectory) listing only the dependencies it needs. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/vopd8z/is_requirementstxt_the_standard_way_to_control/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Plus specialized extras**: It’s common to maintain additional files for different use cases—e.g.
    
    - `requirements.txt` (production/runtime dependencies)
        
    - `requirements-dev.txt` (development tools: linters, formatters, test runners)
        
    - `requirements-test.txt` (testing frameworks and factories)
        
    - `requirements-docs.txt` (Sphinx extensions, doc builders)
        
        Having these separate keeps installs minimal and clearer, and is considered canonical by many tooling authors. [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-9941/Ability-to-specify-multiple-requirements.txt-files?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
- **Shared/common dependencies**: When you have overlap between those files, you can factor out the shared pins into a `requirements-common.txt` that the others include with `r requirements-common.txt`. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74768953/managing-multiple-requirements-txt-dependencies?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Why multiple files make sense

1. **Isolation**
    
    Keeping production vs. development vs. testing dependencies separate avoids accidentally shipping your test tools or docs libraries into production.
    
2. **Performance**
    
    CI jobs or containers install only what they need, speeding up builds and reducing attack surface.
    
3. **Clarity**
    
    New contributors immediately see which tools they need for their workflow (e.g. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`).

## Typical layout in a multi‑project (monorepo) setup

```
text
CopyEdit
/
├── service_a/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── service_b/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── requirements-dev.txt
├── shared_lib/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── docs/
    ├── conf.py
    └── requirements-docs.txt

```

- **Per‑service `requirements.txt`** captures exactly what each service needs at runtime.
- **Dev/test/docs files** live alongside to reduce cross‑pollution.

---

## Bottom line

- **Minimum**: Exactly one `requirements.txt` for _each_ Python project or service in your repo.
- **Common extras**: Add any number of specialized files (`dev`, `test`, `docs`, or a shared common file) to keep things organized and installations lean.

That way, your “big” repo scales naturally: N services → N runtime files, plus however many extras you need for development and testing.

### You said:

what about the [readme.md](http://readme.md)?

### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11 seconds

## Summary of [README.md](http://README.md) Role

A `README.md` is the primary entry point that introduces and explains your project’s purpose, functionality, and usage to developers and users alike [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). It should contain only the essential information needed to get started—extended documentation belongs in wikis or sub‑docs [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Typically you maintain **one** root `README.md` for the overall repository, plus **additional** README files in subdirectories for individual components or services as needed [GitHub](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/blob/master/README-default.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Single vs. Multiple README Files

- **Root README**: A single `README.md` in the repo root serves as the canonical overview for your entire project, linking to deeper documentation and subprojects [GitHub](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Component‑level READMEs**: In a monorepo or multi‑service setup, each service or library with its own directory can have its own `README.md` covering that component’s specific installation, usage, and API details [GitHub](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/blob/master/README-default.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Essential Sections of a Root README

1. Project Title & Badges
    
    Clearly state the project name as the first-level heading, and include badges (build status, coverage, npm/PyPI version) for quick status insights [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/managing-a-drupalorg-theme-module-or-distribution-project/documenting-your-project/readmemd-template?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
2. Description
    
    A concise summary of what the project does, its motivation, and the problem it solves [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
3. Table of Contents
    
    Especially for longer READMEs, a TOC helps users navigate to Installation, Usage, Contributing, etc. [Archbee](https://www.archbee.com/blog/readme-document-elements?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
4. Installation / Getting Started
    
    Step‑by‑step instructions to install dependencies and launch the project (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`) [GitHub](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/blob/master/README-default.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
5. Usage Examples
    
    Code snippets or CLI commands demonstrating common workflows or API calls [Archbee](https://www.archbee.com/blog/readme-document-elements?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
6. Contributing Guidelines
    
    Outline how to open issues, submit pull requests, coding standards, and branch strategies [Hatica](https://www.hatica.io/blog/best-practices-for-github-readme/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
7. License & Authors
    
    State the license clearly and credit the maintainers or contributors [Archbee](https://www.archbee.com/blog/readme-document-elements?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
8. Acknowledgements & References
    
    Link to related projects, third‑party libraries, or any resources that influenced the work [Medium](https://medium.com/%40berastis/creating-a-powerful-readme-best-practices-for-your-project-f974a1e69a51?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

## [README.md](http://README.md) Templates and Standards

- **Standard Readme**: The [standard‑readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) spec outlines a minimal, consistent structure that many open‑source projects follow [GitHub](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **JEHNA Template**: The “readme‑best‑practices” repo provides a ready‑to‑copy template with all core sections preformatted [GitHub](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Make a README**: The [makeareadme.com](http://makeareadme.com) site offers a straightforward “README 101” guide to cover your basics [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Bottom Line

- **One root `README.md`**: Always have a comprehensive, well‑structured `README.md` at the top level of your repo.
- **Additional READMEs as needed**: For each independent service or library folder, maintain its own `README.md` to document its local details.
- **Follow best practices**: Include sections for Title, Description, TOC, Installation, Usage, Contributing, License, and Acknowledgements, using badges and clear formatting to make your README both informative and inviting.

and How many virtual enviomenst should a repo have? let's say I am using uv by astrall.

### ChatGPT said:

## Summary

You should maintain one persistent virtual environment per independent Python project or service in your repository—never committing the environment itself to Git, but letting tools like uv (by Astral) create and manage it automatically. In a monorepo with N separate Python components, you’ll have N environments. Ephemeral environments (via `uvx`) can be spun up on‑demand without polluting your repo. Always isolate dependencies in virtual environments to keep your system Python clean and reproducible.

## Best Practice: One Environment per Project

It’s best practice to create a separate virtual environment for each Python project in order to isolate dependencies and avoid version conflicts [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/a-complete-guide-to-python-virtual-environments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Most virtual environments are directories within the project, conventionally named `venv` or `.venv` when created by `python -m venv` or `uv venv`, and are PEP 405–compliant [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Never Commit Your Environments

You should never commit these environment folders to Git; instead, add patterns like `.venv` or `venv` to your `.gitignore` so that collaborators can recreate environments via requirements files or uv commands [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51654250/virtualenv-should-i-ignore-the-venv-folder?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Using Astral’s uv to Manage Environments

Invoking `uv venv` automatically creates a `.venv` in the current directory, pins the Python interpreter version, and uv commands thereafter detect and use that environment without manual activation [Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Because uv requires a virtual environment by default for pip operations, most workflows will have exactly one persistent `.venv` per independent Python project when using uv [Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

You can even request specific Python versions with uv, e.g. `uv python install 3.12` followed by `uv venv --python 3.12` to support multiple interpreter versions per project [Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Monorepos & Multiple Projects

If your repository contains multiple services or libraries, it’s typical to have one `.venv` per service folder—so with N projects, you’ll have N virtual environments [csguide.cs.princeton.edu](https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/software/virtualenv?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Ephemeral Environments & Custom Paths

For CLI tools or one‑off scripts, `uvx` (alias for `uv tool run`) creates ephemeral environments that aren’t checked into the repo, reducing clutter [GitHub](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Although uv defaults to placing the venv in `.venv` within the project, you can configure custom paths or locate environments outside the repo if you prefer to avoid backing them up or syncing them [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42415933&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Disposable, Reproducible Environments

Virtual environments are disposable and reproducible: if you delete them, you can quickly recreate them with `uv pip sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` thanks to your lockfile or requirements file [Pybites](https://pybit.es/articles/a-better-place-to-put-your-python-virtual-environments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Keep System Python Clean

As a best practice, avoid installing packages into your system Python—use virtual environments exclusively to prevent dependency conflicts and maintain reproducibility [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Bottom Line

- **Persistent envs**: One per independent project or subfolder.
- **Ignored in Git**: Add `.venv`/`venv` to `.gitignore`.
- **Managed by uv**: `uv venv` → auto‑created, auto‑detected.
- **Ephemeral as needed**: `uvx` spin‑ups don’t persist.
- **Monorepo scale**: N projects → N envs.

So what files should only be one for repo? gitnore.? None? Licenses?

## Summary

There are several “singleton” files you almost always want exactly one of at the **root** of your repository. These include the project’s entry‐point docs (`README.md`), license declaration (`LICENSE`), VCS ignore rules (`.gitignore`), and a handful of Git/GitHub “community health” and configuration files. Having exactly one of each at the top level lets GitHub (and your contributors) discover and surface them automatically.

## Mandatory Root Files

- **`README.md`**
    
    The primary landing document for your project, automatically rendered by GitHub on your repo’s front page [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jakebrinkmann/c63eaedbe384516e4a7bc133c1e1066b?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`LICENSE`** (or `LICENSE.md`)
    
    Declares the project’s open‑source license; GitHub even offers a “Choose license” helper when you create a repo [opencdss.state.co.us](https://opencdss.state.co.us/cdss-learn-git/06-lesson-standard-repo-files/lesson-standard-repo-files/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`.gitignore`**
    
    Specifies which files/folders Git should skip; you should have one root `.gitignore` (you _can_ add per‑directory ignores, but the root file is canonical) [opencdss.state.co.us](https://opencdss.state.co.us/cdss-learn-git/06-lesson-standard-repo-files/lesson-standard-repo-files/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`.gitattributes`**
    
    Controls text‑vs‑binary handling, line endings, and other Git behaviors repository‑wide [opencdss.state.co.us](https://opencdss.state.co.us/cdss-learn-git/06-lesson-standard-repo-files/lesson-standard-repo-files/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

## Community Health & Contribution Files

These help GitHub auto‑link guidelines on your Issues/PR pages and surface them in your community profile (via the `.github` folder or root). You should have **one** of each:

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**
    
    Outlines how to file issues, format code, and submit PRs [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jakebrinkmann/c63eaedbe384516e4a7bc133c1e1066b?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**
    
    Your expected community behavior rules; GitHub can even inject a “Community standards” badge [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`SECURITY.md`**
    
    Describes your vulnerability disclosure policy and supported versions [Medium](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`FUNDING.yml`**
    
    Lets you link donation/sponsorship platforms; GitHub shows a “Sponsor” button [Medium](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

## GitHub Workflow & Access Control

Keep exactly one of each at the repo root (or in `.github/`):

- **`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`** (or single `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`) and **`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**
    
    Standardizes issue and PR descriptions for contributors [Medium](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **`CODEOWNERS`**
    
    Defines who is automatically requested for reviews on certain paths [Medium](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

## Citation Support File

- **`CITATION.cff`**
    
    (Optional but recommended for academic/research software) supplies human‑ and machine‑readable citation metadata; GitHub renders it on your project page [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

---

**Bottom Line:**

Your monorepo or multi‑service repo may contain many subfolders, each with their own `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, etc., but _at the root_ you should have **exactly one** of each of the above files so that GitHub and your community tooling recognize and surface them correctly.


I'm doing a big project mono repo on github. How many files of .gitnore/LICENSE/READ.md/.env/requeriments.txt/uv.lock/pyproject.toml/.python-version should I have? One? or Multiple?

### ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 16s

Below is guidance on when to use a single copy of each common file at the **repository root**, and when it makes sense to have **per-project copies** in a Python monorepo. In most cases you’ll want **one** root file for repository-wide concerns, with **additional copies only when a sub-project truly needs its own configuration**.

## Overview

- **Single files at the root**
    
    Use one copy in the repo root for things that apply to _every_ project: overall Git ignores, repository license, top-level documentation, global environment settings, and global tooling configuration.
    
- **Per-project files**
    
    Add copies inside a subfolder only when that project has its own independent lifecycle or custom configuration needs—for example, its own Python package with its own dependencies, lockfile, or Python version.
    

---

## Repository-wide files (usually **one** copy)

### .gitignore

Keep a single `.gitignore` at the root to list all patterns across your monorepo. Having multiple `.gitignore` files is only helpful if you really have _independent_ subprojects with very different build artifacts; otherwise it’s simpler to manage one root file [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3305869/are-multiple-gitignores-frowned-on?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### LICENSE

Include one `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.md`) in the repository root. That single file clearly communicates the license for _all_ code in the repo. GitHub even surfaces it on your project’s main page [Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/567/where-should-i-place-my-open-source-license-file-in-my-project?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### [README.md](http://README.md)

A root `README.md` should describe the overall monorepo: its purpose, layout, how to get started, CI commands, etc. You can add supplemental READMEs inside subdirectories for project-specific details, but the root README is your canonical entry point [GitHub](https://github.com/vanatteveldt/github-workshop/blob/main/tutorials/readme_license_gitignore.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### .env

For shared environment variables (e.g. for CI, Docker Compose, shared tooling), keep one `.env` at the root. Tools like Docker Compose will only automatically load a single top-level `.env` file [GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6392?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and common libraries (TurboRepo, dotenv-cli) recommend a single root `.env` for simplicity [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76415134/unique-env-file-in-monorepo?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

---

## Per-project files (one per Python package or service)

### requirements.txt

If you’re using pip-based workflows, each Python service or library _project_ should have its own `requirements.txt` listing its direct dependencies (pinned for reproducibility). In addition, you might have a root `requirements.txt` (or `dev-requirements.txt`) for shared dev/CI dependencies, but each package needs its own file to declare its runtime needs [Software Innovation Lab](https://tweag.io/blog/2023-04-04-python-monorepo-1/).

### Lock files (e.g. poetry.lock, uv.lock)

Similarly, if you use a tool that produces a lockfile (Poetry’s `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, etc.), each package that you build or publish should maintain its own lockfile next to its `pyproject.toml`. That ensures consistent, reproducible installs per package. If you truly want a single lockfile across the whole repo, you can look into specialized plugins (e.g. “monoranger” for Poetry) but that’s an advanced setup [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gak200/monoranger_a_poetry_plugin_for_managing_monorepos/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### pyproject.toml

Every Python package you intend to build or publish should have its own `pyproject.toml` in its directory to declare metadata, build-system requirements, and dependencies. You may also have a root `pyproject.toml` to configure shared tooling (formatters, linters, CI settings), but each package needs its own for packaging purposes [Software Innovation Lab](https://tweag.io/blog/2023-04-04-python-monorepo-1/). If you instead treat the entire monorepo as a _single_ Python project, you could get away with only one, but that forces a single version number and release cycle [Discussions on Python.org](https://discuss.python.org/t/multiple-related-programs-one-pyproject-toml-or-multiple-projects/17427?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### .python-version

If you’re using pyenv to lock a Python interpreter version, place one `.python-version` at the root to pin the version for all subprojects. Only create additional ones inside sub-folders if a particular service or library genuinely requires a different Python version [lewoudar.medium.com](https://lewoudar.medium.com/pyenv-your-linux-unix-tool-to-manage-different-python-versions-563048c3ad7f?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

---

## Why this split makes sense

A monorepo is simply _multiple logical projects_ in one Git repository [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos?utm_source=chatgpt.com). By centralizing files that truly apply everywhere—ignores, license, top-level docs, shared env—you minimize duplication and make global changes easy. At the same time, letting each Python package declare its own dependencies, lockfile, and version keeps those packages _self-contained_ and independently maintainable when needed.

**In practice:**

1. **Root**
    
    ```
    text
    CopyEdit
    /monorepo
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── .env
    ├── requirements.txt       # shared dev/CI deps
    ├── dev-requirements.txt
    ├── pyproject.toml         # shared tooling config
    ├── packages/
    │   ├── service-A/
    │   │   ├── pyproject.toml
    │   │   ├── poetry.lock
    │   │   ├── requirements.txt
    │   │   └── .python-version
    │   └── lib-B/
    │       ├── pyproject.toml
    │       ├── poetry.lock
    │       └── requirements.txt
    └── .python-version        # global Python version
    
    ```
    
2. **Global changes**
    
    - Update `.gitignore` once for all projects.
    - Rotate license or README content in one place.
    - Tweak CI env in one `.env`.
3. **Local changes**
    
    - Add a new dependency to `service-A/requirements.txt` or its `pyproject.toml`.
    - Re-lock a specific Poetry package in `service-A/poetry.lock`.
    - Override Python version in `service-A/.python-version` if needed.

This balance keeps your monorepo **DRY** at the top level, while preserving **encapsulation** per package.
