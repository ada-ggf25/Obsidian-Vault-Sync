## Summary

The Pair Extraordinaire achievement on GitHub is unlocked when you co‑author commits on a pull request that is subsequently merged into a public repository, celebrating collaboration and teamwork on the platform [DEV Community](https://dev.to/yoan-gilliand/unlock-the-pair-extraordinaire-achievement-on-github-2ah4?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements).

## What Is the Pair Extraordinaire Achievement?

The Pair Extraordinaire badge appears in the **Achievements** section of your GitHub profile after you have at least one merged pull request featuring a commit with a “Co‑authored‑by” trailer that correctly credits one or more additional contributors [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements).

## Achievement Tiers

GitHub supports tiered levels for Pair Extraordinaire based on the number of co‑authored pull requests you have merged:

- **Default (base) badge:** 1 co‑authored merged pull request [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements)
    
- **Bronze (x2):** 10 co‑authored merged pull requests [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements)
    
- **Silver (x3):** 24 co‑authored merged pull requests [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements)
    
- **Gold (x4):** 48 co‑authored merged pull requests [GitHub](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements)
    

Community‑maintained resources such as Awesome GitHub Profiles also list these exact thresholds and match GitHub’s official tiers, offering an alternate way to track your progress outside the GitHub UI [recodehive.github.io](https://recodehive.github.io/awesome-github-profiles/pages/githubbadge.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## How to Earn Pair Extraordinaire

### 1. Create Co‑Authored Commits via Command Line

Include one or more **Co‑authored‑by** trailers at the end of your commit message (after a blank line), formatted exactly as:

	
	Co-authored-by: Name <email>
	

This feature has been supported across the GitHub platform since January 2018 and guarantees both authors receive attribution in the commit graph and pull request timeline [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/).

### 2. Use GitHub Desktop

In **GitHub Desktop**, click the profile icon in the bottom‑left of the commit summary window to add co‑authors before committing. After pushing your branch and merging the pull request, each co‑authored commit counts toward the achievement [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/20467?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### 3. Use Visual Studio Code

The **GitHub Extension** for Visual Studio Code provides an **“Add Co‑authors”** option in the Source Control view. Selecting co‑authors here injects the proper trailers into your commit. Once the pull request containing these commits is merged, the achievement will register [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/53644?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### 4. Merge the Pull Request

Whether you’re contributing to your own repository or someone else’s, the pull request with the co‑authored commits must be **merged** into the default branch for GitHub to award the badge [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/20481?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Tips and FAQs

- **Using Multiple Accounts:** If you don’t have a collaborator readily available, you can co‑author commits with a second GitHub account that you control—just be sure to follow the same “Co‑authored‑by” format [DEV Community](https://dev.to/yoan-gilliand/unlock-the-pair-extraordinaire-achievement-on-github-2ah4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Email Privacy:** To avoid exposing personal email addresses, use GitHub’s no‑reply address (`<username>@users.noreply.github.com`) in your trailer; GitHub will still attribute contributions correctly [GitHub](https://github.com/Prakash4844/Get-Pair-Extraordinaire?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
- **Checking Progress:** Visit your profile’s **Achievements** section to see real‑time progress bars and tier levels. If the badge doesn’t appear immediately after the merge, wait a few minutes and refresh—the update can be delayed slightly [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/37806?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    

By following these steps and ensuring your commits are properly co‑authored and merged, you’ll soon showcase your collaborative skills with the Pair Extraordinaire badge on GitHub.
