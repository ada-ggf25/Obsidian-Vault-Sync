## ‚ùì FAQs

### Can you get an achievement **multiple times**?

- **Not exactly**. You can‚Äôt get a badge more than once, but for tiered ones (e.g., Pull Shark), you **unlock higher levels** (bronze, silver, gold) as you meet new thresholds.

### Are new achievements added?

- Occasionally, yes. GitHub sometimes tests or quietly releases new achievements. Keep an eye on the [Schweinepriester GitHub Achievements Tracker](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements) for updates.
