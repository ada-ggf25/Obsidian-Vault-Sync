Awesome—Stage 2 is where raw, messy sources turn into a **governed graph you can trust**. Below is a _build-ready_ menu of approaches for **Ingestion & Graph Construction**, organised so you can pick per constraint (accuracy, latency, budget, compliance).

> Quick note: I tried to pull in live references (Microsoft GraphRAG pipeline, Neo4j’s GraphRAG Field Guide, AWS Neptune GraphRAG), but my browsing tool is timing out right now. I’ll add citations the moment it cooperates or if you share specific links you want me to align with.

# 2) Ingestion & Graph Construction — the full pipeline

## A) Source onboarding (what you pull and how)

- **Structured (DBs/APIs):** direct ETL/ELT; keep **stable business keys**; schedule CDC for deltas.
    
- **Semi-structured (CSV/JSON, logs):** schema-on-read; enforce types early; normalise timestamps/timezones.
    
- **Unstructured (PDF/DOCX/HTML/email):**
    
    - Text extraction: PDF (pdftotext, Tika), HTML readability parsers, DOCX extractors.
        
    - OCR for scans (Tesseract); keep confidence scores.
        
- **Streaming:** Kafka/Kinesis topics for events (deployments, tickets, alerts). Treat each event as a first-class **event node**.
    

**Deliverables:** source registry (owner, update cadence, PII flags), access method, parse function, failure policy.

---

## B) Normalisation & segmentation (prep for IE)

- **Cleaning:** remove boilerplate/HTML cruft, expand abbreviations, normalise units.
    
- **Segmentation:** chunk to **TextUnits** (e.g., ~300–800 tokens) with **semantic boundaries** (headings, list items). Store offsets.
    
- **Metadata:** attach source, URI, author, created_at, hash, and access labels (RBAC/tenant).
    

**Why:** your graph facts will cite these TextUnits for provenance.

---

## C) Information Extraction (IE): pull entities, relations, events, claims

### 1) Classical pipelines (fast/cheap, lower recall)

- **NER + Rule patterns:** spaCy/HF models for entities; regex/templates for relations (e.g., “A depends on B”).
    
- **Heuristic relations:** co-occurrence within window + type/rule filters.
    

### 2) LLM-assisted extraction (high recall, needs guardrails)

- **Prompted JSON schemas:** ask the LLM to emit `{entities:[], relations:[], events:[], qualifiers:…}` strictly; reject/repair if invalid.
    
- **Function-calling / tool-calling:** define extraction functions; enforce types at the tool boundary.
    
- **Dual-pass / verifier:** _proposer_ LLM extracts; _verifier_ LLM (or rules) checks types, cardinalities, time plausibility, and source coverage.
    
- **Claim extraction:** represent statements like “Service A latency spiked on 2025-07-12” with time qualifiers.
    

### 3) Hybrid

- **Rules first** for easy wins; **LLM for the rest** (fallback).
    
- **Weak supervision:** label few high-quality examples → train a light RE/NER for scale; keep LLM for tails.
    

**Outputs you should store:**

- **Entities** (with candidate canonical IDs)
    
- **Relationships** (binary) _and/or_ **Events** (n-ary)
    
- **Claims** (textual assertions with qualifiers)
    
- **Provenance links**: every fact → supporting TextUnits (+ character offsets)
    

---

## D) Graph construction patterns (what the graph _looks_ like)

### 1) Binary edge (simple, fast)

`(Service)-[:DEPENDS_ON {source, valid_from}]->(Service)`

### 2) Event/statement node (handles n-ary + qualifiers)

```
(Change {id, at, pr:"PR-123"})
  -[:AFFECTS]->(Service A)
  -[:INTRODUCED]->(Version 2.4)
  -[:EVIDENCE]->(TextUnit {doc_id, span})
```

Use this for **multi-participant events**, **time**, **who/where**, **source**, and to avoid cramming qualifiers into a single edge.

### 3) Temporal fields

- **valid_from/valid_to** on edges/nodes for valid time.
    
- Optional **transaction_time** for audit (bi-temporal).
    

### 4) RDF variant (if you’re SPARQL/ontology-first)

- Use **n-ary relation pattern** nodes (W3C) for events/claims.
    
- Constrain with **SHACL**; use **PROV-O** for provenance.
    

---

## E) Entity resolution (ER) & canonicalisation

### 1) Deterministic

- Exact keys (service_id, email, ticket_id), normalised forms (case/whitespace).
    

### 2) Probabilistic / ML

- **Blocking** (candidate generation via n-grams/soundex/token sets).
    
- **Similarity features** (Levenshtein, Jaccard, embedding cosine).
    
- **Scoring** (learned classifier or weighted rules); threshold → **merge queue**.
    

### 3) Graph-aware disambiguation

- Prefer matches that **maximise neighbourhood consistency** (same owner, same environment).
    
- Use **temporal overlap** to rule out impossible merges.
    

### 4) Canonical record

- Choose **winner ID**; keep `:ALIAS_OF` edges for audit.
    
- Record **merge provenance** (who/what decided; scores).
    

---

## F) Enrichment & standardisation

- **Controlled vocabularies / ontologies:** map severities, regions, product names to master lists (or SKOS concepts).
    
- **Unit normalisation:** durations, sizes, currencies (store original + canonical).
    
- **Reference joins:** link to CMDB, HRIS, cloud inventory; enrich with golden IDs.
    

---

## G) Quality gates & validation (stop bad facts early)

- **Syntactic:** required fields, type checks, enum membership.
    
- **Semantic:** cardinalities (e.g., one primary owner), time logic (from < to), referential integrity.
    
- **Cross-fact:** contradicting claims? flag for review.
    
- **RDF path:** **SHACL shapes** (NodeShapes, PropertyShapes) to enforce constraints.
    
- **Sampling & HITL:** send a percentage of new facts to reviewers; build a feedback loop to improve prompts/rules.
    

---

## H) Provenance, audit & reproducibility (non-negotiable)

- For _every_ entity/relation/event/claim store:
    
    - **source_id, uri, TextUnit span, extraction_time**
        
    - **extractor version** (prompt hash, model name, code version)
        
    - **confidence** (model score / heuristic score)
        
- Keep **raw artefacts** (original docs/logs) immutable; store **hashes** for audit.
    

---

## I) Privacy & security during ingestion

- **PII detection/redaction** before prompts (names, emails, tickets with PII).
    
- **Access labels** per node/edge; store tenant/org IDs.
    
- **Read-only** service principals for any generated queries downstream.
    

---

## J) Incremental & streaming updates

- **Idempotency:** derive **natural keys** for events/facts so replays don’t duplicate.
    
- **Upserts with time:** extend `valid_to` on superseded facts; add new version.
    
- **Triggers:** when high-impact nodes change (e.g., Service), schedule **summary refreshes** (global/community reports).
    
- **Backpressure & DLQs:** queue failures with context; retry policies per source.
    

---

## K) Performance & cost tactics

- Batch IE (nightly/stream micro-batches); cache schema/pattern prompts.
    
- **Two-tier extraction:** quick pass for routing/anchors; deep pass for critical entities only.
    
- Limit LLM calls by **heuristic pre-filters** (run LLM only if rules don’t decide).
    
- Parallelise per document / per chunk; dedupe by document hash.
    

---

## L) Minimal “reference” pipeline you can copy

1. **Extract** text → segment into **TextUnits** with offsets.
    
2. **LLM IE** (JSON schema): entities, relations, events, claims (+ provenance).
    
3. **Verifier** (rules + small model): type/cardinality/time checks; reject/repair.
    
4. **ER & canonicalise:** deterministic → probabilistic; record merges.
    
5. **Construct graph:** binary edges for simple facts; **event nodes** for n-ary/time-qualified; attach **EVIDENCE** edges to TextUnits.
    
6. **Validate:** semantic rules/SHACL (if RDF); sample to human review.
    
7. **Upsert** with valid_time; **emit change events** to trigger global summary refreshes.
    
8. **Log everything** (source, offsets, extractor version, confidence).

## Guardrailed LLM IE prompt (sketch)

**System:**  
“You extract _only_ entities, relations, events, claims present in the provided text. Output strict JSON matching the schema. If unsure, omit.”

**User:**

- Schema (entities with allowed types & properties)
    
- Examples (positive/negative)
    
- TextUnit content (≤ 800 tokens)
    

**Tools:**

- `emit_extractions(json)` (validator rejects anything off-schema)
    
- `report_issue(reason)` (for low-confidence/garbage scans)
    

---

## What to decide _now_ (so Stage 3 goes smoothly)

- Event-as-node vs pure edges (if you need time/qualifiers → event nodes).
    
- Natural keys for idempotent upserts.
    
- ER policy (thresholds, manual queue).
    
- Minimum provenance you’ll store (doc, span, extractor version).
    
- Which facts are **HITL-gated** before they go live.

If you share your **real sources** (CMDB, incident tickets, change logs, PDFs) and the **entities/relations** you expect, I’ll turn this into a concrete ingestion spec: JSON schemas for LLM extraction, validation rules, ER thresholds, Cypher upsert patterns, and event-node designs—plus a plan for streaming deltas and summary refresh triggers.
