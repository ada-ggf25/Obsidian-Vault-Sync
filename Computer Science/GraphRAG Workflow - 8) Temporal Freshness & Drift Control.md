Absolutely—Stage 8 is where you keep answers **time-correct** and **self-aware about drift** (facts change, embeddings get stale, summaries age). Below is a concrete playbook you can actually wire into your GraphRAG stack.

# What you’re controlling

- **Temporal freshness**: are we answering “as of _now_” or “as of _T_”?
    
- **Drift control**: what do we do when sources conflict across time, or when global summaries/embeddings lag behind updates?
    

---

# A) Model time so you can _ask time_

You can’t retrieve “as of June 12, 2024” unless the graph _represents_ time.

1. **Valid time & transaction time (bi-temporal)**
    
    - Add `valid_from`/`valid_to` (real-world truth window) and optionally a separate **transaction time** (when your system learned/recorded it). This is standard temporal DB practice and lets you answer both “what was true then?” and “what did we _record_ then?”.
        
2. **RDF side (if you’re RDF/SPARQL):** use **OWL-Time** to describe instants/intervals and their relations (before/after/during), so temporal logic is queryable and consistent.
    
3. **Snapshot vs. valid-time queries (property graphs):** Neo4j’s docs highlight two common needs: **graph snapshot** (state at a point-in-time) and **graph difference** (what changed between T1 and T2). Both are easier when edges/nodes carry valid-time properties.
    

> Minimal rule: every edge/fact that can change over time gets `valid_from`/`valid_to` (and, if you need audit, also `tx_time`). Neo4j supports native temporal types for these fields.

# B) Time-aware retrieval defaults

Wire temporal logic into every retriever so you don’t leak future info into past answers.

- **As-of filter (local GraphRAG):** constrain traversals/paths to edges whose `valid_from ≤ as_of ≤ valid_to`.
    
- **Windowed search:** when users ask “last week/quarter,” restrict both seeders (BM25/vector) and traversals to that window.
    
- **Tie-breakers:** when multiple versions match, prefer the one **closest** to the requested time T.
    
- **Global vs local mixing (DRIFT):** DRIFT augments local answers with community (global) cues, which is powerful but only if your _global_ artifacts are fresh (see next section).
    

---

# C) Keep _global_ artifacts fresh (and cheaper)

GraphRAG’s global mode uses **community summaries**; these go stale as your corpus evolves. Microsoft introduced two optimizations you should copy:

- **DRIFT for local questions:** blend community context into local search to widen the starting set without blowing cost.
    
- **Dynamic global search:** do **relevance rating before map-reduce** so you summarize only the communities that matter; MS reports large token-cost reductions at similar quality. Schedule rebuilds and use dynamic selection at query time.
    

**Operationally**

- Rebuild **community summaries** on a cadence (e.g., nightly) _and_ trigger partial refreshes when high-impact nodes/edges change.
    
- Version summaries and keep a “summary_as_of” timestamp; DRIFT/global prompts should cite it.
    

---

# D) Stream changes in, update the right indexes

Freshness dies without incremental ingest.

- Use **change data capture (CDC)** or event streams to upsert graph facts and _emit invalidations_ for affected summaries/embeddings. CDC is the standard pattern to propagate only deltas, not re-ingest everything.
    
- **Selective re-embedding:** only re-embed the changed **TextUnits / entities / ego-nets**; batch low-priority items.
    
- **Invalidate caches** keyed by `(query type, entity ids, as_of window)` when inputs change.
    

---

# E) Conflict handling (temporal drift resolution)

When sources disagree (or facts changed):

1. **Explain the conflict**: show both facts with **timestamps & sources**; pick the one closest to the requested time T for the main answer.
    
2. **Prefer newer for “latest”**, but don’t hide the older if it’s still within the user’s window.
    
3. **Temporal GraphRAG patterns**: recent research (T-GRAG) explicitly decomposes temporal queries and retrieves across evolving subgraphs to reduce ambiguity and redundancy—useful if you serve lots of time-sensitive questions.
    

---

# F) Ranking with time

Bake time into fusion/rerank:

- **Recency boost** for “latest” questions; **proximity-to-T** boost for “as-of” questions.
    
- **Structure-aware rerank**: prefer shorter, time-valid paths; demote hubs that span very long intervals.
    
- **Diversity across time** (MMR with a time distance feature) when the user wants trends.
    

---

# G) Generation rules (make time explicit)

- Always state the **temporal scope** in answers: “As of 2025-08-08 …” by default, or the user’s **as-of date** if provided.
    
- For tables/metrics, **compute via governed aggregators** that take a time filter (not from LLM memory).
    
- In global summaries, cite **community report versions** (and their dates).
    

---

# H) Evaluation for temporal correctness

Add tests that target time:

- **Temporal Hit@k**: did we retrieve facts valid at the asked time?
    
- **Leakage checks**: does an “as of 2023” query accidentally use 2024+ edges?
    
- **Staleness SLOs**: % of answers built from artifacts ≤ N days old (summaries, embeddings).
    

---

# I) Minimal blueprint you can copy

1. **Model**
    
    - Add `valid_from`, `valid_to` to mutable edges/nodes; add `tx_time` if you need audit; use **OWL-Time** classes if in RDF.
        
2. **Ingest**
    
    - Wire **CDC** → upsert facts → emit “touch sets” (which communities/entities/ego-nets changed).
        
3. **Index & refresh**
    
    - Re-embed only touched items; nightly **community summary** rebuild, plus on-demand partial rebuilds; store `summary_as_of`.
        
4. **Retrieve**
    
    - Default **as-of = now**; when user specifies T, enforce temporal filters throughout seeders+traversals; for corpus-level asks use **dynamic global**; for local asks consider **DRIFT**.
        
5. **Rank**
    
    - Apply **proximity-to-T** and time-validity boosts; demote stale or cross-window facts.
        
6. **Generate**
    
    - Print the time scope; show conflicting facts with dates; use only time-valid evidence.
        
7. **Observe**
    
    - Track % of answers citing artifacts older than your freshness SLO; alert when over threshold.

# When you might go further

- **Bi-temporal audit & rollbacks** (regulatory): keep both valid and transaction time so you can reconstruct “what we _knew_ on date D,” not only “what was true on date D.”
    
- **Temporal global optimization**: if global questions dominate, lean into **dynamic global search** to cut costs without losing quality.
    
- **Full temporal GraphRAG**: if time is central (finance/legal/news), consider a pipeline like **T-GRAG** that decomposes temporal queries and retrieves over evolving subgraphs.
    

If you share your top **time-sensitive question types** (e.g., “as of”, “compare periods”, “what changed between”), I can sketch the exact Cypher/SPARQL filters, the CDC triggers to refresh summaries/embeddings, and the rerank weights for proximity-to-time that fit your data.
