Stage 11 is where you make GraphRAG **fast, predictable, and affordable**. Think in three layers: (A) graph-side performance, (B) vector/hybrid retrieval performance, and (C) token + orchestration spend. Below is a pragmatic menu of **things you can actually turn on**—with knobs, defaults, and when to use them.

---

# Goals (set these first)

- **Latency SLOs** by question class (e.g., lookup ≤2s P95; investigative ≤8s).
    
- **Cost budgets** (max tokens / reranker calls / tool calls per request).
    
- **Throughput targets** (QPS & concurrency).
    

Have these in a config so you can _enforce_ them with step limits, timeouts, and fallback paths.

# A) Graph-side performance (Neo4j-focused tips)

### 1) Use the right indexes (and let the planner do its job)

Neo4j 5 has **search-performance indexes** (range, text, point, token lookup) and **semantic indexes** (full-text, vector). The Cypher planner will start your pattern match at the best indexed anchor—your job is to index the properties you actually filter on (ids, names, timestamps). Don’t over-index.

- Create/manage search-performance indexes for hot filters; profile queries to confirm the plan uses them.
    
- **Full-text** (Lucene) is great for fuzzy seed finding; choose analyzers and consider eventual consistency if you can tolerate slight lag.
    
- **Vector indexes** exist for nodes _and_ relationships (Neo4j). Configure memory and **warm the index** with a few queries to prime OS cache (handy after deploys).
    
- In rare edge cases, **index hints** can force a start point—use sparingly and only after profiling.
    

### 2) Driver & query hygiene

Use read sessions for reads, shard heavy reads across replicas, and profile long-tail queries. (Neo4j’s driver perf guide has concrete examples.)

---

# B) Vector & hybrid retrieval (speed/recall vs memory $$$)

### 1) Pick an ANN index that fits your SLA

- **HNSW** → low latency / high recall; higher RAM. Tune `M`, `ef_construction`, and query-time `ef_search` for recall vs latency. (OpenSearch/Milvus docs give concrete trade-offs.)
    
- **IVF / IVF_PQ** → memory-efficient at huge scale; tune `nlist` (partitions) and `nprobe` (probed lists) for throughput vs recall. (Milvus docs walk through the parameters.)
    
- **Hybrid HNSW_PQ** → compress with PQ, then retrieve with HNSW; refine if needed. Useful when RAM is tight but you want HNSW speed.
    
- Byte/quantized vectors (OpenSearch) can cut memory with modest recall loss—good for very large corpora.
    

### 2) Filter efficiently

Use **ANN-native filtering** (Lucene/FAISS filters) so you don’t fetch huge candidate sets only to drop them—a big win under tight SLAs.

### 3) Always run **hybrid retrieval** (lexical + vector) unless you have a reason not to

Issue BM25 and vector in parallel, then fuse with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**. Azure AI Search ships this pattern out-of-the-box and documents the math & config; you can add **semantic reranking** after RRF if the extra latency is worth the precision.

---

# C) Global layer cost controls (GraphRAG “global vs local”)

Microsoft’s **DRIFT** combines _global_ (community summaries) and _local_ (neighborhood facts) **to improve quality while controlling compute**. Use DRIFT for broad asks, then drill down; for narrow entity questions, stay local. (Docs + MSR blog cover the method and why it’s cheaper than naively summarizing _everything_ every time.)

**Ops tip:** Rebuild community summaries on a cadence and **version** them with `summary_as_of` so you can detect staleness (ties into Stage 8).

---

# D) Token & model spend (cheap context, same answers)

### 1) Shorten what you send

Use **RRF-fused top-k** + graph-aware re-rank to keep only diverse, time-valid snippets/paths. Then apply **prompt compression** if the pack is still big.

- **LLMLingua / LongLLMLingua**: compress prompts 2–20× with small quality loss; measurable cost/latency reductions. Great as a last mile step before generation.
    

### 2) Right-size the heavy models

- Cross-encoder/LLM rerankers help—but keep them **optional** behind a latency/cost flag; try semantic reranking only on borderline cases. (Azure’s semantic ranker is a documented, paid add-on.)
    
- Use **smaller models** (or cached results) for clarifications, routing, and classification; save the big model for final synthesis.
    

---

# E) Caching & reuse (biggest dollar saver in practice)

- **Seed cache:** BM25/vector results for popular queries or entities.
    
- **Path cache:** shortest paths / frequent motifs between hot entities.
    
- **Summary cache:** community reports; refresh selectively when touched.
    
- **Index warmup:** fire a handful of vector queries after deploy to page indexes into memory—Neo4j calls this out for vector indexes.
    

---

# F) Guardrails that _also_ help performance

- **Hard caps**: hops, per-node degree, max paths, LIMITs, and timeouts (both Cypher and ANN). These protect P95 and cloud bills.
    
- **Read-only roles + allow-lists** for Text2Cypher keep queries small and safe (and prevent accidental full scans).
    

---

# G) Observability & auto-tuning

- Log: query text, used indexes, row counts, ANN params (`ef_search`, `nprobe`), tokens, and which cache hit.
    
- Watch: **P50/P95**, **token per answer**, **% calls that needed reranking**, **cache hit rate**, and **recall@k** on a tiny rolling gold set.
    
- Auto-tune: if recall falls, nudge `ef_search`/`nprobe`; if latency blows up, reduce k or increase MMR diversity to cut context.

# Starter blueprint (copy/paste)

1. **Indexes**
    
    - Neo4j: range/text on ids/names/time; full-text for fuzzy seeds; vector on TextUnits (and on Entities if you do similarity lookups). Let the planner pick starts; profile.
        
2. **ANN**
    
    - HNSW for low-latency, memory-rich; IVF_PQ for very large corpora; tune `ef_search` or `nprobe` per SLA.
        
3. **Hybrid retrieval**
    
    - Parallel BM25 + vector → **RRF** fuse → (optional) semantic rerank **only** if score margins are small.
        
4. **Global vs local**
    
    - Use **DRIFT** for broad questions, local for narrow; rebuild & version community summaries.
        
5. **Context shaping**
    
    - Graph-aware re-rank (short, time-valid paths), **MMR** for diversity, then **LLMLingua** if still too long.
        
6. **Budgets**
    
    - Cap steps, hops, paths, tokens; put Text2Cypher behind read-only, limited schemas.
        
7. **Warm & cache**
    
    - Warm vector indexes post-deploy; cache seeds/paths/summaries aggressively.

If you give me your **current SLOs**, **data scale** (docs, entities, edges), and whether you’re on **Neo4j-only** or **Neo4j + external vector DB**, I’ll turn this into a concrete tuning sheet: which indexes to create, default ANN params (`M`, `ef_search`, `nlist`, `nprobe`), RRF + semantic rerank thresholds, DRIFT toggles, and a caching plan tailored to your workload.
