Excellent request — **LangGraph** is one of the most exciting new frameworks in the LLM ecosystem.

Let’s do a similar **deep dive into LangGraph** — what it is, why it exists, how to use it, and how it relates to LangChain.

---

# 🌟 What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is an **extension of LangChain** that lets you create **stateful, multi-actor LLM applications** represented as a **graph**.

👉 Think of it as a way to turn **linear LLM chains** into **arbitrary workflows**:

- with **loops**,
    
- **branches**,
    
- **multiple agents or tools** interacting,
    
- **stateful reasoning** over multiple turns.
    

**Tagline:**  
_"Composable multi-actor applications using LLMs, represented as graphs."_

# 🚀 Why LangGraph?

### Problem with vanilla LangChain:

- **LangChain "Chains" are linear**: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Done.
    
- If you want loops, branching logic, "thinking in multiple stages", it gets complex and messy.
    

### Enter LangGraph:

✅ **Graph-based execution**: Nodes → Edges → Arbitrary topologies  
✅ **Loops supported** → for multi-turn conversations  
✅ **Branches supported** → decision points  
✅ **Shared state** → nodes can update and pass along state  
✅ **Multi-agent orchestration** → coordinate multiple LLM agents

**In short:** LangGraph turns your LLM app from a _pipeline_ into a _workflow_.

# 🏗️ Core Concepts

### 1️⃣ **Graph**

- A **graph** of nodes and edges.
    
- Nodes = computation steps (LLM calls, tools, logic, memory updates...).
    
- Edges = "which node to go to next".
    

### 2️⃣ **State**

- A **shared state object** passed through the graph.
    
- Nodes can read and update state.
    
- Enables complex workflows and memory.
    

### 3️⃣ **Builder API**

```python
from langgraph.graph import END, Graph

graph = Graph()
graph.add_node("my_node", my_node_fn)
graph.set_entry_point("my_node")
graph.set_finish_point(END)
```

### 4️⃣ **Loops and Branches**

- Graph supports cycles (loops).
    
- You can define **conditional edges** based on the state:
    
    ```python
    graph.add_conditional_edges(
        "node_name",
        condition_fn,
    )
    ```
    

### 5️⃣ **Multi-agent support**

- Each node can be an **LLM agent**, a **tool**, a **database lookup**, or even another graph.
    
- You can build **multi-agent systems** with different behaviours and capabilities.

# 🖼️ Visual Example

```plaintext
User → Planner → Executor → Memory → Loop back → Planner → END
```

Or:

```plaintext
User → (Branch)
           ↘ Research Agent → END
           ↘ Writing Agent → END
```

---

# ⚙️ Basic Example

### Install

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain langchain_openai langgraph_openai
```

---

### Simple Graph

```python
from langgraph.graph import Graph, END
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

# A simple node
def my_node(state):
    user_input = state["input"]
    response = llm.invoke(f"Summarise this: {user_input}")
    state["summary"] = response.content
    return state

# Build graph
graph = Graph()
graph.add_node("summarise", my_node)
graph.set_entry_point("summarise")
graph.set_finish_point(END)

# Run graph
output = graph.invoke({"input": "LangGraph lets you build graph-based LLM apps."})
print(output["summary"])
```

---

### Conditional Branching Example

```python
def planner_node(state):
    user_input = state["input"]
    if "research" in user_input:
        state["branch"] = "research_agent"
    else:
        state["branch"] = "writing_agent"
    return state

graph.add_node("planner", planner_node)

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "planner",
    lambda state: state["branch"]
)

graph.add_node("research_agent", research_node)
graph.add_node("writing_agent", writing_node)
```

Now your graph will **branch at runtime**!
