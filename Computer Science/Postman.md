## 🧩 What Postman Does

- **Build and Send HTTP Requests**  
    You can craft and execute HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to simulate interactions with your application’s API or external services — and examine responses like status codes, headers, and JSON payloads.([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-tech/introduction-postman-api-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Introduction to Postman for API Development"))
    
- **Organize API Requests into Collections**  
    Group related requests in **Collections** and **folders**, store environment variables, and reuse them. Collections can be run manually or automatically for testing workflows.([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-tech/introduction-postman-api-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Introduction to Postman for API Development"), [Postman Docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman documentation overview"))
    
- **Write Scripts for Testing & Automation**  
    Use JavaScript in Postman’s “sandbox” to create automated tests, validate responses, run setup or teardown steps before/after requests, and pass data between requests.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/application-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application Development | Use Cases"))
    
- **Generate and Share Documentation**  
    Postman auto-generates documentation from your collections, which can be published for internal teams or public APIs—ideal for onboarding new developers.([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-tech/introduction-postman-api-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Introduction to Postman for API Development"), [Postman Docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman documentation overview"))
    
- **Mock APIs & Simulate Endpoints**  
    Create **mock servers** to simulate API endpoints early in development, enabling frontend and backend developers to work in parallel.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/application-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application Development | Use Cases"))
    
- **Collaborate via Workspaces**  
    Multiple developers can share **Workspaces** where API artifacts, schemas, tests, and changes are tracked and visible in real time.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Postman? Postman API Platform"), [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman: The World's Leading API Platform | Sign Up for Free"))
    
- **Design with API Specifications**  
    Built‑in support for OpenAPI, GraphQL, RAML formats lets you design APIs as a **single source of truth**, generate collections from schemas, and maintain version history.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/application-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application Development | Use Cases"))
    
- **Monitor & Govern API Quality**  
    Use built‑in monitoring, governance rules, security warnings, and reports to ensure APIs meet your organization’s standards.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman for Developers"), [Postman Docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman documentation overview"))
    
- **AI-Powered Tools**  
    Recent versions include AI-powered assistance—auto-generating test scripts, visualizing API responses, and debugging through tools like **Postbot** or Flows.([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postman_%28software%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman (software)"), [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Postman: The World's Leading API Platform | Sign Up for Free"))

## ✅ How It Helps in Coding

1. **Debug APIs faster**: Rather than waiting for your code to run in an app, test endpoints directly during development.
    
2. **Automate API testing**: Build test suites that validate your code’s responses under different conditions.
    
3. **Prototype APIs early**: Using mock servers lets frontend devs start without waiting on backend code.
    
4. **Generate code snippets**: Postman can output boilerplate code in languages like JS, Python, or curl—handy for integrating your calls into scripts or apps.([postman.com](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/application-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application Development | Use Cases"))
