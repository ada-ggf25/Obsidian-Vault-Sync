I have everything set up on vs code I have the docker destop app runing on the background I want the container to pass to the docker how can I do that?

Great — since you already have:

✅ Your FastAPI project set up in **VS Code**  
✅ **Docker Desktop** running in the background  
✅ A `Dockerfile` ready

Now all you need is to **build** your Docker image and **run** the container. Here's exactly what to do from VS Code terminal:

---

## 🚀 Step-by-step from VS Code

### 1. **Open terminal** in the root folder of your FastAPI project

You should see your `Dockerfile` in this directory.

---

### 2. **Build your Docker image**

```bash
docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
```

> 🔁 This reads your `Dockerfile`, installs dependencies, and prepares the image.

You’ll see messages like:

```
Successfully built <IMAGE_ID>
Successfully tagged my-fastapi-app:latest
```

---

### 3. **Run the container**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-fastapi-app
```

> This tells Docker to run your app and expose port `8000` so you can access it on your browser.

---

### 4. **Visit your FastAPI app**

Open your browser and go to:

📎 [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You should see:

```json
{"message":"Hello, Docker + FastAPI!"}
```

Or if you added custom endpoints, they’ll show up too.

📘 Try this too: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for the **interactive API docs**.

---

## 🧼 (Optional) Stop and remove the container

To see running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

To stop a container (replace `<container_id>` with actual ID):

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove it:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

If you want to automate this or use VS Code's **Docker extension** to build and run from the GUI, I can walk you through that too. Want that?
