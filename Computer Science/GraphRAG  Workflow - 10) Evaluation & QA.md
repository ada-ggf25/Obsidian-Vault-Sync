Awesome—**Stage 10: Evaluation & QA** is where you prove your GraphRAG works (and keep it working). Below is a practical, end-to-end blueprint you can copy into your design doc. I’ve split it into **what to measure**, **how to build test sets**, **offline vs. online eval**, **tooling**, and **how to wire it into CI/CD**.

---

# What to measure (and why)

## 1) Retrieval quality

- **Classic IR**: Precision/Recall/F1, **MRR**, **MAP**, **nDCG**—useful to compare retrievers and hops/templates. These are standard IR metrics used for RAG retrieval comparisons.
    
- **RAG-specific context metrics**:
    
    - **Context Precision / Context Recall** — proportion of retrieved chunks that are relevant, and whether the relevant ones were retrieved at all. Ragas operationalises these specifically for RAG.
        
    - **Context Utilization / Entity Recall / Noise Sensitivity** (optionally) to see whether the model actually used the right pieces and resisted distractors.
        

## 2) Answer quality & grounding

- **Faithfulness / Groundedness** — do claims in the answer follow from the provided context? (Core metric in Ragas and in TruLens’ “RAG triad”.)
    
- **Answer Relevance / Correctness** — is the answer on-topic and correct given ground truth? (Phoenix and TruLens provide built-in evaluators.)
    
- **Task metrics** — EM/F1 for QA, ROUGE/BLEU for summarisation, etc., when you have gold answers.
    

## 3) Graph-specific correctness (add these for GraphRAG)

- **Path correctness** — does at least one returned explanation path match a labelled gold path/motif? (Your gold set should include node/edge/temporal evidence.)
    
- **Temporal correctness** — are edges/nodes on the path valid **as-of** the query time? (No “future leakage”.)
    
- **Global vs. local balance** — for DRIFT/global queries, check that cited facts actually come from the selected communities and that drill-downs include representative exemplars (MS GraphRAG/DRIFT emphasises this global↔local mix).
    

## 4) Efficiency & reliability

- **Latency / P95**, **cost (tokens, tool calls)**, and **abstention rate** (how often you correctly say “insufficient evidence”).
    
- **Staleness** — percent of answers built from summaries/embeddings older than your freshness SLO (tie-in with Stage 8).

# Building the test sets (golden data)

Create **small but surgical gold sets** per question archetype (from Stage 0):

- **Local QA**: (question, gold answer, gold supporting nodes/edges/paths, gold text spans).
    
- **Path/Relation**: (A, B, **gold path(s)** and acceptable motifs) + time window.
    
- **Global/DRIFT**: (broad question, **expected communities/themes**, exemplar docs) to test global → local behaviour. (DRIFT mixes global insights with local refinement—your gold should too.)
    
- **Temporal**: “as of/compare periods” questions with gold evidence scoped to time.
    

Good practice: keep **10–50 items per archetype** to start; expand over time. Store gold in a format your evaluator can consume (IDs for nodes/edges + doc spans).

# Offline vs. online evaluation

## Offline (pre-deployment / CI)

- Run the pipeline on **frozen corpora** and compute: retrieval metrics, RAGAS (faithfulness, context precision/recall), path/temporal checks, EM/F1/ROUGE if available. Use this to compare retrievers (lexical/vector/hybrid), hops, templates vs Text2Cypher, and DRIFT vs local/global.
    

## Online (production / canary)

- **Trace each request** end-to-end and compute **feedback functions** on the fly (TruLens’ approach) — groundedness, context relevance, answer relevance — plus latency and token budgets. Alert on regressions.
    
- Use an observability platform (Phoenix) to **run evaluators continuously**, visualise failures, and set alerts (e.g., hallucination rate > threshold). Integrations exist with LlamaIndex/Haystack/Milvus.

# Tooling (batteries included)

- **Ragas** — turnkey metrics for RAG: faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision/recall, plus extras (utilisation, entity recall, noise sensitivity). Great for offline and batch.
    
- **TruLens** — “RAG triad” (groundedness, context relevance, answer relevance) + **feedback functions** that run alongside your app; excellent for online tracing/experiments.
    
- **Arize Phoenix** — production-grade tracing + evals; pre-tested evaluators for retrieval relevance & Q/A correctness; dashboards and alerts. Works with LlamaIndex/Haystack.
    
- **GraphRAG/DRIFT materials** — use the official docs to craft DRIFT/global tests and to sanity-check that “global then local” behaviour is happening.

# Reference evaluation plan (you can copy-paste)

## A. Retrieval suite

1. Run **BM25**, **vector**, and **hybrid** seeders; compute **MRR/nDCG** over gold seeds.
    
2. Compute **Context Precision/Recall** (Ragas) on the final retrieved contexts.
    
3. For graph-paths: check **path correctness** (exact motif or set equality) and **temporal validity** (`valid_from ≤ T ≤ valid_to`).
    

## B. Answer suite

1. **Faithfulness** and **Answer Relevancy** (Ragas).
    
2. **Groundedness / Answer Relevance / Context Relevance** (TruLens RAG triad) to cross-validate.
    
3. **Task metric** (EM/F1, ROUGE) when you have labelled answers.
    

## C. DRIFT/global checks

- For global/corpus questions, assert that the **selected communities** match gold and that cited exemplars come from those communities; compare DRIFT vs local/global baselines.
    

## D. Efficiency & safety

- Track **latency P95**, **token/tool budgets**, **abstain rate**.
    
- Log provenance (node/edge IDs, doc spans) for every claim to enable audits (as per GraphRAG’s artifact model).

# CI/CD: gating and regression control

- **Threshold gates** in CI:
    
    - Retrieval: nDCG@k and Context Recall@k must not drop > X%.
        
    - Generation: Faithfulness ≥ T, Answer Relevancy ≥ T.
        
    - DRIFT/global: community-hit rate ≥ T on global set.
        
- **A/B** new retrievers or prompts; treat token/latency as first-class metrics.
    
- **Canary deploy** with Phoenix/TruLens running online evals; auto-rollback on alert.

# Tips that save weeks

- Start with **Ragas + a tiny gold set** to iterate quickly; add **TruLens/Phoenix** once you go to staging so you see live traces and metric drift.
    
- For GraphRAG, **test modes separately** (Local, Global, DRIFT) and keep **mode-specific dashboards**; DRIFT should reduce misses on entity-specific questions by widening the starting set.
    
- Don’t over-index on a single score. A stable set typically includes **Context Precision/Recall + Faithfulness + Answer Relevance + nDCG/MRR + latency/tokens**.

If you share two or three **representative questions per archetype** (local, path, global/DRIFT, temporal) and what **SLOs** you’re targeting, I’ll draft a concrete **eval harness** (Ragas/TruLens/Phoenix configs + a tiny gold set schema) that you can drop straight into CI.
