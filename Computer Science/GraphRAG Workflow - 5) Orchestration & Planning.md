Nice—this is the fun bit. **Stage 5: Orchestration & Planning** is where you decide _how the system decides_. Think “who calls which retriever, in what order, with what budgets, and with which safety rails.” Below is a practical menu of options you can mix-and-match, with pointers to solid references.

# 5) Orchestration & Planning

## A) Core orchestration styles

### 1) Deterministic pipelines (rule-based routing)

Route each **question archetype** to a fixed sequence of tools:

- _Example:_ “lookup → template query → evidence pack → answer,” or “global (community summary) → drilldown → answer.”
    
- **Pros:** predictable latency, easy to test/audit; ideal for high-governance flows.
    
- **How to design:** lean on your Stage-0 archetypes and Microsoft GraphRAG’s **Global / Local / DRIFT** split for routing rules. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))
    

### 2) Agentic planners (multi-step tool use)

Let a controller plan–act–observe in loops (ReAct-style): pick a tool, execute, inspect results, decide next step, stop when confident. Use this for heterogeneous, investigative questions (RCA, multi-hop). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"))

Upgrades to basic ReAct you can consider:

- **Search/planning with trees (LATS):** Monte-Carlo tree search + value models to explore alternative tool sequences. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in ..."))
    
- **Agentic GraphRAG with RL (Graph-R1):** treat retrieval as an _interactive_ process and optimise the entire loop with rewards. (Very new, but worth tracking.) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21892?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Graph-R1: Towards Agentic GraphRAG Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning"))
    

### 3) Supervisor / multi-agent coordination

A **supervisor** routes work to specialised agents (retrieval, aggregator, text2cypher, summariser) and manages hand-offs. LangGraph provides off-the-shelf patterns for this (supervisor, swarm, handoffs). ([GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "langgraph/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.md at main ..."), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com "LangGraph"), [LangChain AI](https://langchain-ai.lang.chat/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Workflows & agents"))

---

## B) Toolbelt (what the planner can call)

- **Seeders:** lexical (full-text/BM25), vector, hybrid, entity-linking, or **Global** (community summaries). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))
    
- **Traversals:** neighbourhood (k-hop, degree caps), path queries, motifs/metapaths, temporal filters. (See Neo4j GraphRAG field guide for catalogued retriever patterns.) ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/graphrag-field-guide-rag-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GraphRAG Field Guide: Navigating the World of Advanced RAG Patterns"))
    
- **Structured queries:** **Query templates** (governed) and **Text2Cypher** (dynamic, guarded). ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/graphrag-field-guide-rag-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GraphRAG Field Guide: Navigating the World of Advanced RAG Patterns"))
    
- **Aggregators:** counts, trends, group-bys (tables for the LLM to verbalise).
    
- **Evidence fetchers:** pull supporting **TextUnits** / sources tied to nodes/edges (MS GraphRAG model). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Overview - GraphRAG"))
    

> Pattern to remember: **Agentic traversal often _uses_ Text2Cypher as one of its tools**—the planner decides _when_ to call it.

---

## C) Planning policies (how the agent chooses tools)

1. **Static router:** simple classifier/regex over the user question → select pipeline/tools.
    
2. **Embedding router:** nearest-neighbour routing over question exemplars.
    
3. **Learned policies:** bandits or RL over historical success/latency (see Graph-R1 for end-to-end RL framing). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21892?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Graph-R1: Towards Agentic GraphRAG Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning"))
    
4. **Tree search:** branch over alternative tool sequences; prune with value estimates (LATS). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in ..."))
    

---

## D) Budgets, stop conditions, and retries (make loops safe)

- **Budgets:** max steps, max tool calls, max tokens, per-tool timeouts.
    
- **Stop conditions:** confidence threshold, no-new-info detection, or “two consecutive no-op steps.”
    
- **Backoff & retries:** transient datastore errors, vector index timeouts.
    
- **Caching:** memoise seed results, common paths, aggregates, and **global** summaries (MS GraphRAG’s DRIFT relies on reusing community summaries). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/query/drift_search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DRIFT Search - GraphRAG"))
    

---

## E) Guardrails (must-haves for prod)

- **Function/tool calling best practices:** define tools with strict JSON schemas and validate before execution. (OpenAI function-calling docs.) ([Plataforma OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Function calling - OpenAI API"))
    
- **Agent guardrails:** run _input_ and _output_ checks in parallel with the agent to block unsafe/off-policy actions or prompt for clarification. (Agents SDK guardrails.) ([openai.github.io](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Guardrails - OpenAI Agents SDK"))
    
- **Text2Cypher hardening:** read-only DB role; allow-listed labels/rel-types/functions; static lint that rejects writes/DDL; cap result rows/time. (Neo4j’s field guide discusses **Dynamic Cypher** / Text2Cypher as an advanced pattern—treat it as a privileged tool.) ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/graphrag-field-guide-rag-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GraphRAG Field Guide: Navigating the World of Advanced RAG Patterns"))
    
- **Provenance & RBAC:** every retrieved fact carries the source TextUnit + timestamps; enforce tenant/label filters in _every_ query (aligns with GraphRAG’s provenance emphasis). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Overview - GraphRAG"))
    

---

## F) Choosing between deterministic vs agentic

Use **deterministic pipelines** when you need:

- strict latency SLOs,
    
- auditability/consistency,
    
- well-trodden question classes (templates exist),
    
- or regulated domains.
    

Use **agentic planners** when:

- questions are ambiguous/heterogeneous,
    
- you must mix seeds, traversals, and aggregates in unknown orders,
    
- or you want to **combine global + local** adaptively (DRIFT-style). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/query/drift_search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DRIFT Search - GraphRAG"))
    

Many teams deploy **hybrid routing**: try deterministic first; if confidence is low or the ask is out-of-distribution, escalate to the agent (with tight step/time budgets).

---

## G) Observability & evals (so you can improve the planner)

- **Trace every step:** tool called, params, rows/paths returned, timings, token costs.
    
- **Store decision rationales** (lightweight) for offline review (ReAct traces are inherently interpretable). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"))
    
- **Compare strategies:** A/B test pipelines vs agentic loops on your gold sets; measure retrieval hit@k, faithfulness, and end-to-end latency.
    
- **LangGraph tooling** gives you persistence and debugging UX for stateful runs and multi-agent flows. ([LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com "LangGraph"), [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/langgraph-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python – Real Python"))

## H) Reference orchestration patterns you can adopt

1. **Global-first drilldown (MS GraphRAG/DRIFT):**  
    Global (community summaries) → pick top communities → local neighbourhoods around exemplars → aggregate → answer. Great for corpus-level asks. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))
    
2. **Lookup / table answers (governed path):**  
    Router → template query (or guarded Text2Cypher) → evidence → table → verbalise. P95 latency target, easy audits. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/graphrag-field-guide-rag-patterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GraphRAG Field Guide: Navigating the World of Advanced RAG Patterns"))
    
3. **Investigation / RCA (agentic):**  
    ReAct loop: semantic seeding → temporal k-hop → path over changes/incidents → an aggregate via Text2Cypher → stop. Add max-6 steps + time window default. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629?utm_source=chatgpt.com "arXiv:2210.03629v3 [cs.CL] 10 Mar 2023"))
    
4. **Supervisor multi-agent:**  
    Supervisor routes between _Retriever_, _Aggregator_, _Text2Cypher_, _Synthesiser_. Use **handoffs** for clean transitions; log per-agent costs. ([GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "langgraph/docs/docs/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor.md at main ..."))

## I) Minimal implementation checklist

- **Router** (static or learned) that emits `{pipeline, budgets}`.
    
- **Planner** (deterministic or agentic) with:
    
    - tool registry (seeders, traversals, templates, Text2Cypher, aggregators),
        
    - guardrails (schema validation, allow-lists, RBAC filters),
        
    - budgets (steps, time, rows, tokens).
        
- **State store / traces** (LangGraph or your own) for replay & debugging. ([LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com "LangGraph"))
    
- **Fallbacks:** if the agent times out or confidence < T, degrade to deterministic “best effort” (e.g., hybrid search + short neighbourhood).
    
- **DRIFT-style global/local integration** if you serve many corpus-level questions. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/query/drift_search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DRIFT Search - GraphRAG"))
