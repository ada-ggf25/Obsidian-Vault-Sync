[[Numba Vs Cython]]

Cython is a **superset of Python** that lets you write Python-like code and add **optional static types**, then **compiles it to C/C++** and builds a CPython extension module. The result runs much faster (often C-level speed) and can call C/C++ libraries directly.

### Why it’s used

- **Speed up hot loops** by adding types (`cdef int i`) and avoiding Python object overhead.
- **Wrap C/C++** libraries with a Pythonic API (FFI with `cdef extern from ...`).
- **Release the GIL** for true parallel threads in C sections.

### Mini example

```
# file: fastsum.pyx
cpdef long sum_array(long[:] a):     # typed memoryview over a NumPy array
    cdef Py_ssize_t i, n = a.shape[0]
    cdef long s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s += a[i]
    return s

```

Build with a small `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` (or `pyximport`), then `import fastsum` from Python.

### Key features

- **Optional typing**: more types → more speed.
- **Typed memoryviews**: zero-copy access to NumPy arrays.
- **`nogil` blocks**: real multithreading in the compiled part.
- **Direct C interop**: call functions/structs from headers; no ctypes overhead.

### Cython vs Numba vs pybind11 (quick)

- **Cython**: ahead-of-time compile, maximal control, great for **wrapping C/C++** and squeezing performance. Requires a build step and learning some Cython syntax.
- **Numba**: JIT at runtime with decorators, fastest to try for **pure-Python numeric loops**, limited Python features, weaker C++ interop.
- **pybind11**: write **C++** and expose to Python elegantly; best if your core is already C++.

### When to reach for Cython

- You need predictable **AOT builds** (wheels/CI) and portability.
- You want **tight control** over types, memory layout, and GIL.
- You’re **binding C/C++** libs or hand-optimizing kernels that NumPy/Numba can’t handle cleanly.

In short: **Cython = Python + types → C extension**, ideal for high-performance sections and seamless C/C++ integration.
