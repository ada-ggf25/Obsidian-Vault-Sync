Short answer: **Conda** is the _tool_; **Miniconda** is a _small distro that ships that tool_.

- **conda**  
    The package & environment manager itself (the CLI: `conda create`, `conda install`, etc.). You can get conda from different distributions (Anaconda, Miniconda, Miniforge/Mambaforge).
    
- **Miniconda**  
    A **minimal installer** that gives you:
    
    - Python
        
    - the `conda` CLI
        
    - just the bare essentials (no big scientific stack preinstalled)
        

For context:

- **Anaconda** = Python + `conda` + **lots** of preinstalled data-science packages + GUI (Navigator). Big download.
    
- **Miniconda** = Python + `conda` + almost nothing else. Tiny download; you add only what you need.
    
- **(Mini/Mamba)forge** = Like Miniconda but defaults to the **conda-forge** channel (and Mambaforge includes the faster solver `mamba`).
    

**When to pick Miniconda:** you want a lightweight setup and to install only the packages you actually need.  
**When to say “conda”:** you’re referring to the command/tool you’ll use inside any of these distributions.
