### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Setting Up WSL on Windows

#### 1. **Install WSL**

On Windows 10 (version 2004 and higher) or Windows 11, you can install WSL by following these steps:‚Äã[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
    
    - Click on the Start menu, type "PowerShell", right-click on "Windows PowerShell", and select "Run as administrator".‚Äã
        
2. **Install WSL:**
    
    - In the PowerShell window, enter the following command:‚Äã
        
        powershell
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `wsl --install`
        
    - This command will enable the necessary features, install the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as the default version, and install the Ubuntu distribution by default.‚Äã[Microsoft Learn+1Microsoft Learn+1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
3. **Restart Your Computer:**
    
    - After the installation completes, you'll be prompted to restart your machine.‚Äã[Microsoft Learn+1Visual Studio Code+1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the official Microsoft documentation: [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).‚Äã[Microsoft Learn+1Microsoft Learn+1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### 2. **Set Up Your Linux User Account**

After restarting, launch the installed Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Start menu.‚Äã

- You'll be prompted to create a new UNIX username and password. This account is separate from your Windows user account and will be your default user for the Linux environment.‚Äã[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

#### 3. **Update and Upgrade Packages**

It's a good practice to update your package lists and upgrade installed packages:‚Äã

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

#### 4. **Install Development Tools**

Depending on your development needs, you can install various tools. For example, to install Python and pip:‚Äã

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`

For Node.js development, you can use Node Version Manager (nvm):‚Äã

bash

CopyEdit

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash`

After installing nvm, restart your terminal and install Node.js:‚Äã

bash

CopyEdit

`nvm install node`

#### 5. **Integrate with Visual Studio Code**

To enhance your development experience, you can use Visual Studio Code with the WSL extension:‚Äã

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
    
    - Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).‚Äã
        
2. **Install the WSL Extension:**
    
    - In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.‚Äã
        
    - Search for "WSL" and install the "Remote - WSL" extension.‚Äã
        
3. **Open a WSL Project in VS Code:**
    
    - In your WSL terminal, navigate to your project directory and type:‚Äã[Reddit+3Visual Studio Code+3Microsoft Learn+3](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
        bash
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `code .`
        
    - This will open the current directory in VS Code, running in the context of your WSL environment.‚Äã

        ```
        
    - Save and exit.
        
2. **Apply the Changes**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
    
    ```
    

This method allows for granular control over your prompt's appearance.
