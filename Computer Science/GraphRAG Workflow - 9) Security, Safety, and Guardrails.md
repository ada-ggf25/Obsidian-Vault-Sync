Absolutely — **Stage 9: Security, Safety, and Guardrails** is where your GraphRAG goes from “cool demo” to “production-grade.” Below is a practical blueprint you can lift into your design doc. I split controls by _plane_ (data, model, tools/queries, retrieval, generation, and ops), and mapped them to well-known risks so your security team can sign off.

# Threat model (use this to justify controls)

Anchor your risks to the **OWASP Top-10 for LLM Applications (2025)**: prompt/indirect injection, insecure output handling (downstream code exec), data leakage, excessive agency, supply-chain, model DoS, etc. It’s the clearest, LLM-specific checklist we have today.  
Also keep a line item for **prompt injection** in RAG/GraphRAG (direct + _indirect_ via retrieved content/web/pages).

---

# A) Data plane: governance, access, and minimization

**Goal:** Least privilege + provenance end-to-end.

- **RBAC/ABAC on the graph:** Use **Neo4j Enterprise** fine-grained auth. Constrain _read_ and _traverse_ by label, relationship, property predicates, and even procedure/function execution. Tie roles to IdP (OIDC/LDAP/SSO).
    
- **Subgraph scoping:** Model tenants/sensitivity as properties/labels; grant **property-based** read/traverse only when predicates (e.g., `n.secret <> true`) hold.
    
- **Provenance as a first-class field:** Store **TextUnit → Entity/Relation/Claim** links; answers must cite these IDs (supports audits & trust). This is baked into Microsoft’s GraphRAG dataflow.
    

**Checklist:** roles & privileges; property predicates; encrypted secrets; PII redaction before indexing & prompting; provenance on every fact.

# B) Model & prompt plane: keep the LLM on policy

**Goal:** Prevent prompt/indirect injection from hijacking instructions.

- **Strict instruction hierarchy:** system > developer > user > _retrieved content_; never merge raw retrieved text into the instruction channel.
    
- **Injection filtering on retrieved content:** scan TextUnits for “instruction-like” patterns; drop or quote them. (Mitigates **LLM01 Prompt Injection** / _indirect_ injection.)
    
- **Don’t trust outputs blindly:** any output that could trigger side effects (shell/Cypher/SPARQL, HTTP calls) must be validated by a policy layer before execution (mitigates “insecure output handling”).
    

---

# C) Tool & query plane (Text2Cypher, templates, aggregators)

**Goal:** Generated queries are **read-only, bounded, validated**.

- **Prefer templates for common asks**; reserve **Text2Cypher** for long tail. Neo4j’s Text2Cypher work shows it’s powerful, but treat it as privileged.
    
- **Hard guardrails for Text2Cypher**:
    
    - DB user with **read-only role** only.
        
    - **Allow-list** labels, relationship types, functions/procedures; deny writes/DDL/APOC mutation before execution.
        
    - **Static validator** parses Cypher and rejects anything off-policy; force `LIMIT` and timeouts; parameterize inputs (no string interpolation).
        
    - **Row/time caps** and safe fallbacks on timeout.  
        (All align with Neo4j’s RBAC/execute-privilege model.)
        
- **Schema exposure:** only expose a **sanitized schema view** to Text2Cypher. (Neo4j’s research shows schema presentation strongly affects generation—control it.)
    

---

# D) Retrieval plane: safe seeding & traversal

**Goal:** Don’t let untrusted text drive unsafe behavior.

- **Hybrid seeding with filters:** vector/BM25 seeds + strict **label/time/tenant** filters _before_ traversal. (Blocks over-expansion and reduces exposure to poisoned text.)
    
- **Time-scoped traversals** by default (avoid leakage from future facts; ties into Stage 8).
    
- **Global (community) artifacts as trusted accelerants:** Use **community reports** for global questions, but version them and declare _as-of_ times (DRIFT/dynamic global search patterns).
    

---

# E) Generation & output plane: grounded and constrained

**Goal:** Answers only from evidence; no side-effectful content sneaks through.

- **Grounded prompting:** “Use only EVIDENCE; if missing, say you don’t know; include citations (node/edge IDs and doc spans).” That’s exactly how GraphRAG structures TextUnits/Entities/Relationships → answers.
    
- **Structured outputs for tables/JSON:** enforce a JSON Schema; reject non-conforming outputs before returning to callers (prevents “insecure output handling”).
    
- **Red-flag patterns:** strip/escape code blocks or URLs in answers unless the request explicitly asked and your policy allows.
    

---

# F) Operations: monitoring, rate-limits, and red-teaming

**Goal:** Make abuse detectable and survivable.

- **Rate-limits & budgets** per user/tenant (tokens, steps, time). Helps with **LLM DoS/unbounded consumption**.
    
- **Full trace logging:** tool calls, Cypher text, parameters, row counts, durations, token use, and **evidence IDs** used in the final answer (ties back to provenance).
    
- **Security reviews & red team:** validate that prompt/indirect injection doesn’t cross trust boundaries (see academic work showing prompt→SQL/Cypher injection chains).
    
- **Supply-chain hygiene:** pin LLM/model versions, vectorizer versions, and prompt hashes in logs (OWASP “supply chain” class).

## Putting it together — a minimal policy you can ship

1. **Graph auth:** Readers get only `TRAVERSE/READ` for allowed labels/rels; sensitive properties gated by predicates; procedure/function execution allow-listed.
    
2. **Text2Cypher gateway:** read-only db user, schema allow-list, static Cypher linter (reject writes/APOC-mutations), param binding, row/time caps, query & result logging.
    
3. **Prompt hardening:** retrieved text is data, not instructions; injection scanner on TextUnits; block “system prompt disclosure” strings.
    
4. **Grounded generation:** require citations to **TextUnit & path IDs**; structured outputs for tables; block unsafe content types by default.
    
5. **Ops & audits:** end-to-end provenance, per-tenant budgets, rate-limits, anomaly alerts on query volume/path length, and quarterly red-team against injection→query chains.

## Extras worth considering

- **Property-based “temporal RBAC”** (e.g., only traverse edges valid in current quarter for some roles). Neo4j supports property-predicate guards for read/traverse.
    
- **Policy-as-code for graphs:** if you outgrow RBAC, research exists on **graph-aware XACML** (path-sensitive authorization) you can adapt.

If you want, I can turn this into a **security checklist** tailored to your stack (Neo4j + Text2Cypher + GraphRAG global/local/DRIFT), including: example **Cypher privilege grants**, a **Text2Cypher validator spec**, a **prompt-injection scanner** for TextUnits, and the **audit fields** to log on each request.
