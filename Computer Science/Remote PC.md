### You said:

both pc need to connected to the intenet correct?

### ChatGPT said:

Yes, both your home PC and your laptop need to be connected to the internet if you wish to access your home PC remotely while you're away. The internet serves as the bridge between the two devices, enabling remote desktop software to transmit data and control signals between them.

However, if both devices are on the same local network‚Äîfor example, connected to the same Wi-Fi router at home‚Äîyou can establish a remote connection without internet access. In this scenario, the devices communicate over the local network, and the remote desktop connection remains confined within your home network.

For remote access over the internet, ensure that:

- Your home PC is powered on and connected to the internet.
- Remote desktop software (such as Chrome Remote Desktop, Microsoft Remote Desktop, TeamViewer, or AnyDesk) is properly configured and running on your home PC.
- Your laptop has internet access and the corresponding client software installed to initiate the remote connection.

By meeting these requirements, you can securely access and control your home PC from virtually anywhere.
