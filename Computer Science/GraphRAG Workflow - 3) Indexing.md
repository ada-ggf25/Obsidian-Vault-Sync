Alright, Stage 3—**Indexing**—is where you make your GraphRAG _fast_, _cheap_, and _consistent_. Think of it as laying multiple “highways” into the corpus: lexical (full-text), semantic (vectors), and graph-native (labels/properties/relationships). You’ll usually deploy **all three** and sometimes a **global layer** (community summaries) that behaves like an index for corpus-level questions.

Below is a build-ready menu of what to index, why, and how—plus when to pick which combo.

# 3) Indexing — the menu

## A) Graph-native indexes (anchors for traversals)

These are the primary “entry points” for Cypher/SPARQL traversals. In Neo4j, the planner uses **search-performance indexes** (range, text, point, token lookup) to find fast starting nodes/edges; you don’t have to specify usage—the planner chooses—but you _do_ choose which properties to index. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/using-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The impact of indexes on query performance - Cypher Manual"))

- **Range / Text / Point / Token lookup (Neo4j)**: classic property and label/type indexes to speed MATCH starts. Use for IDs, names, timestamps, types you filter on a lot. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/managing-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create, show, and delete indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data ..."))
    
- **Full-text (graph-native, Lucene-powered)**: tokenised inverted index over string properties for nodes _and_ relationships; supports analyzers and (optionally) eventual consistency. Best for fuzzy seed-finding before graph hops. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/full-text-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Full-text indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
- **How it’s used:** Full-text is called via procedures; search-performance indexes are used automatically by the planner to “start patterns in the right place.” ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/syntax/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Syntax - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    

## B) Vector indexes (semantic entry points)

Embeddings of chunks, entities, or even relationships let you grab semantically similar items as seeds.

- **Neo4j vector indexes (nodes _and_ relationships)** with `db.index.vector.queryNodes/Relationships()`; you set dimensions + similarity (cosine, etc.). Good when you want vectors _inside_ the same graph store that you traverse. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vector indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
- **External vector engines** if you need scale/features:
    
    - **Milvus/Zilliz**: IVF_FLAT / IVF_PQ / HNSW families; on-disk and memory trade-offs documented, plus guidance on picking an index. ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/ivf-flat.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "IVF_FLAT | Milvus Documentation"), [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/learn/how-to-pick-a-vector-index-in-milvus-visual-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Pick a Vector Index in Your Milvus Instance: A Visual Guide"))
        
    - **OpenSearch / Elasticsearch**: k-NN (Faiss/NMSLIB under the hood), plus neural/hybrid features. ([GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Find the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for your vector data"), [Opster](https://opster.com/guides/opensearch/opensearch-machine-learning/how-to-set-up-vector-search-in-opensearch/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Set Up Vector Search in OpenSearch - Opster"))
        
    - **Lucene HNSW** (dense in Lucene; integrated stacks): useful context on dense+BM25 in one engine. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12139?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anserini Gets Dense Retrieval: Integration of Lucene's HNSW Indexes"))
        
    - **Faiss** (background trade-offs paper). ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08281?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Faiss library"))
        

**When to embed what?**

- **Chunks** → for classic question→passages.
    
- **Entities** → for “find similar things (services/tickets) by meaning.”
    
- **Relationships** → for “similar edges” retrieval (Neo4j supports relationship vector indexes). ([python.langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/neo4jvector/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Neo4j Vector Index | ️ LangChain"))
    

## C) Hybrid indexing (lexical + vector together)

For real-world QA you want _both_ exact term matches (BM25) **and** semantic matches—then fuse.

- **OpenSearch hybrid**: run BM25 + vector; **normalize scores** then combine. (Built-in patterns and best practices.) ([OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/building-effective-hybrid-search-in-opensearch-techniques-and-best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Building effective hybrid search in OpenSearch: Techniques and best ..."), [Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/hybrid-search-with-amazon-opensearch-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid Search with Amazon OpenSearch Service"))
    
- **Weaviate hybrid**: BM25F + vector with configurable fusion/weights in a single system. ([weaviate.io](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search | Weaviate Documentation"), [docs.weaviate.io](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/concepts/search/hybrid-search?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search | Weaviate Documentation"))
    
- **Azure AI Search hybrid**: BM25 + HNSW/eKNN with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** to merge into one ranking. ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn"))
    

**Why hybrid?**  
Lexical catches names/IDs/numbers; vectors capture paraphrase/semantics. Fusing them materially improves recall and robustness for RAG/GraphRAG. ([OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/building-effective-hybrid-search-in-opensearch-techniques-and-best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Building effective hybrid search in OpenSearch: Techniques and best ..."))

## D) “Global layer” indexes (corpus-level)

Microsoft’s GraphRAG builds **community summaries** (via graph clustering + LLM summaries) that act like an _index of themes/sections_ across the corpus—used for “global” questions; “local” uses neighbourhood hops; **DRIFT** blends the two. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))

- **What to persist:** cluster IDs on entities, per-community reports, and sometimes per-community embeddings (so you can vector-search _themes_). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Overview - GraphRAG"))
    
- **Why it matters:** global entries become cheap, high-signal candidates before you fan-out locally.

# How to wire it (practical patterns)

## 1) Seed-finding stack

- **Primary**: BM25/Full-text for exact names/IDs + **Vector** for semantics (hybrid). ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/full-text-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Full-text indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"), [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn"))
    
- **Global**: if the query is corpus-level, jump into **community summaries** first, then sample cited entities/claims as seeds. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))
    

## 2) Graph traversal entry

- Always have **property/label indexes** on hot filters (ids, names, time ranges) so your MATCH starts fast; the planner will use them. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/using-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The impact of indexes on query performance - Cypher Manual"))
    
- Keep a **full-text** index for relationship text if you store messages/notes on edges (yes, Neo4j full-text supports relationships). ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/full-text-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Full-text indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    

## 3) Vector details that bite later

- **Specify dimensions & similarity** when creating Neo4j vector indexes; use the cheat-sheet patterns to avoid syntax gotchas. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/current/vector_index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cypher Cheat Sheet - Neo4j Documentation Cheat Sheet"))
    
- **Pick the right ANN family** if external:
    
    - **HNSW** → low latency, higher RAM.
        
    - **IVF_FLAT/IVF_PQ** → better memory/throughput; tune nlist/nprobe & quantization. (Milvus docs have concrete trade-offs.) ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/ivf-flat.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "IVF_FLAT | Milvus Documentation"))
        
- **On-disk options** (DiskANN-style) matter once vectors explode beyond RAM. ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/index-explained.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Index Explained | Milvus Documentation"))
    

## 4) Hybrid fusion you can explain to auditors

- **Early fusion** (single engine, one query): Weaviate/Azure AI Search provide built-in score blending or RRF. ([weaviate.io](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search | Weaviate Documentation"), [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn"))
    
- **Late fusion** (two queries, then merge): do BM25 + vector separately (OpenSearch guidance), normalize, and RRF/weighted-sum. ([OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/building-effective-hybrid-search-in-opensearch-techniques-and-best-practices/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Building effective hybrid search in OpenSearch: Techniques and best ..."), [Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/hybrid-search-with-amazon-opensearch-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid Search with Amazon OpenSearch Service"))
    

## 5) Operational knobs

- **Analyzers** for full-text (language, email, etc.), including consistency model (fully consistent vs eventually consistent) in Neo4j. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/performance/index-configuration/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Index configuration - Operations Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
- **Planner visibility**: you don’t hint indexes in Neo4j—create the right ones and let the planner start patterns there. Avoid over-indexing. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/using-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The impact of indexes on query performance - Cypher Manual"))
    
- **Versioning** for global summaries: store community report versions and refresh cadence; GraphRAG’s indexing architecture describes the pipeline pieces to regenerate them. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/architecture/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indexing Architecture - GraphRAG"))

# Recommended “starter” combos (by use case)

- **Entity lookups & path questions** (fast response, audited):  
    **Property indexes** on IDs/names/time + **Full-text** (names/notes) to seed → traverse. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/managing-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create, show, and delete indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data ..."))
    
- **General QA over messy text** (most enterprise QA):  
    **Hybrid** (BM25 + vector) to seed → graph **k-hop** around seeds → (optional) re-run **Text2Cypher** for aggregates. Use **Neo4j vector index** if you want one DB; otherwise OpenSearch/Milvus. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vector indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"), [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hybrid search - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn"))
    
- **Corpus-level “themes” & summaries:**  
    Jump via **community summaries** (global layer) then drill down locally (DRIFT). ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Welcome to GraphRAG - GitHub Pages"))
    
- **Very large embeddings at low cost:**  
    External vector DB with **IVF_PQ/HNSW** tuned for your recall/SLA; keep graph for traversal. ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/ivf-flat.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "IVF_FLAT | Milvus Documentation"))

# Minimal, copy-paste index plan (Neo4j-first)

1. **Search-performance indexes** on hot properties (IDs, names, timestamps). ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/search-performance-indexes/managing-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create, show, and delete indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data ..."))
    
2. **Full-text** index on document/edge text for fuzzy seed-finding. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/full-text-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Full-text indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"))
    
3. **Vector** indexes for:
    
    - **TextUnit** chunks (semantic doc search),
        
    - **Entity** nodes (entity similarity), and (optionally) **relationship** embeddings. ([Graph Database & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vector indexes - Cypher Manual - Neo4j Graph Data Platform"), [python.langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/neo4jvector/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Neo4j Vector Index | ️ LangChain"))
        
4. **Global layer**: persist **community IDs** and **community reports**; (optionally) embed reports for fast theme search. ([Microsoft GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/index/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Overview - GraphRAG"))
    

If you share your **entity list**, **query types**, and **SLOs**, I’ll turn this into exact Cypher for creating the right Neo4j indexes (full-text + vector on the right labels/properties), plus a hybrid pattern (OpenSearch/Weaviate/Azure) if you want lexical+semantic in one query.
