A **wrapper** in computer science is a construct—typically a function, class, or library—that “wraps” around another component to provide a different or simplified interface, add functionality, or adapt one interface to another. Wrappers leverage encapsulation to hide complexity from clients, enabling easier integration, code reuse, and compatibility across systems. Below is an overview of common types of wrappers and their roles.

## 1. Wrapper Functions

Wrapper functions are subroutines whose sole purpose is to call another function or system call, often adding minimal logic such as error checking, logging, or input validation before delegating to the wrapped routine ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper function")). They simplify coding by abstracting third-party or low-level APIs, so that if the underlying function changes, only the wrapper needs updating ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper function")). Wrapper functions can also adapt interfaces—renaming parameters, setting defaults, or combining multiple calls into one—for greater convenience and safety ([ITU Online IT Training](https://www.ituonline.com/tech-definitions/what-is-a-wrapper-function/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is A Wrapper Function? - ITU ...")).

## 2. Wrapper Classes

A wrapper class contains an instance of another class or data type and forwards calls to it, often with additional behavior such as validation, caching, or access control ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3293752/where-and-how-is-the-term-used-wrapper-used-in-programming-and-what-does-it-h?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Where and how is the term used \"wrapper ...")). In object-oriented languages, wrapper classes implement patterns like **Adapter** or **Facade**, providing a simpler or standardized interface atop more complex subsystems ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_%28object-oriented_programming%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Forwarding (object-oriented programming)")). Java’s wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Boolean`) encapsulate primitive types as objects, enabling them to be used in collections or with generics ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_wrapper_classes.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Java Wrapper Classes")).

## 3. Wrapper Libraries

Also called library wrappers or shims, these are thin layers of code that translate one library’s interface into another’s, or expose functionality across language boundaries ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_library?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper library")). Wrapper libraries are implemented using design patterns such as Adapter, Façade, or Proxy, and are crucial for cross-language or cross-platform interoperability (e.g., a C++ wrapper around a C API) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_library?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper library")).

## 4. Service Wrappers

Service wrappers enable arbitrary programs to run as background services (Windows Services or Unix daemons) by satisfying OS-specific requirements and often adding monitoring or lifecycle management ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_wrapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Service wrapper")). They “wrap” executables so they can start at boot, be managed by service controllers, and report health metrics or logs in a standardized way ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_wrapper?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Service wrapper")).

## 5. Wrapper in Data Mining

In information extraction, a wrapper is a procedure that parses semi-structured or unstructured data (e.g., HTML pages) into structured relational tuples ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_%28data_mining%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper (data mining)")). **Wrapper induction** automates the creation of such extraction routines by learning patterns from examples, enabling reliable data harvesting from evolving web templates ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_%28data_mining%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Wrapper (data mining)")).

## 6. Forwarding (Wrapper Object)

Forwarding objects—often called wrapper objects—delegate select methods or properties to an internal “wrappee” instance while possibly handling others themselves ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_%28object-oriented_programming%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Forwarding (object-oriented programming)")). This supports fine-grained control over which functionality is exposed directly versus forwarded, and distinguishes from delegation by who “owns” the method context (`self`) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_%28object-oriented_programming%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Forwarding (object-oriented programming)")).

**Key Takeaway:**  
Wrappers are an essential abstraction mechanism in software engineering, enabling developers to:

1. **Encapsulate** complexity and present consistent interfaces,
    
2. **Adapt** incompatible components without modifying their source,
    
3. **Enhance** functionality (e.g., logging, validation), and
    
4. **Facilitate** interoperability across languages, platforms, or protocols.
    

By choosing the appropriate wrapper type—function, class, library, or service—you can improve modularity, maintainability, and robustness in your systems.

Here’s a simple Python example showing how a **wrapper** (via a decorator) can add logging around any function call:

```python
def log_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Before calling the original function
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)               # Call the wrapped function
        # After calling the original function
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sum_result = add(5, 3)
    print("Sum is:", sum_result)
```

### How it works

1. The **decorator** `log_decorator` takes a function `func` as input and defines an inner function `wrapper` that accepts any arguments (`*args, **kwargs`) ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/decorators-in-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Decorators in Python")).
    
2. Inside `wrapper`, you can execute code **before** and **after** calling the original `func`—here, printing the arguments and the return value ([freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-decorator-handbook/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Python Decorator Handbook")).
    
3. Returning `wrapper` replaces `add` with this new function, so that whenever you call `add(…)`, you actually invoke `wrapper(…)`, which in turn calls the original `add` and adds logging around it ([realpython.com](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Primer on Python Decorators")).
    

This pattern lets you **wrap** any existing function—adapting its behavior (e.g., adding logging, timing, caching)—without modifying its source code.
