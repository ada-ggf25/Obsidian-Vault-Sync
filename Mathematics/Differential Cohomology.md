Differential cohomology is a mathematical framework that integrates both topological and geometric information of smooth manifolds. It refines traditional cohomology theories by incorporating differential forms, thus capturing both the global topological structure and the local geometric details of a manifold.[Numdam+3Wikipedia+3arXiv+3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[NCATLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/differential%2Bcohomotopy?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Core Components

For a smooth manifold MMM, differential cohomology groups, denoted H^k(M)\hat{H}^k(M)H^k(M), are equipped with the following natural maps:

- **Characteristic class map**: H^k(M)→Hk(M;Z)\hat{H}^k(M) \to H^k(M; \mathbb{Z})H^k(M)→Hk(M;Z), which retrieves the underlying topological class.
- **Curvature map**: H^k(M)→Ωclosedk(M)\hat{H}^k(M) \to \Omega_{\text{closed}}^k(M)H^k(M)→Ωclosedk(M), assigning a closed differential form that represents the curvature.
- **de Rham class map**: H^k(M)→HdRk(M)\hat{H}^k(M) \to H_{\text{dR}}^k(M)H^k(M)→HdRk(M), connecting to de Rham cohomology by identifying the cohomology class of the curvature form.[Wikipedia+1Abdul's webpage+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv+1Wikipedia+1](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14338v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia+1Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%9E-Chern%E2%80%93Weil_theory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These maps are interrelated in a way that ensures consistency between the topological and differential data.[arXiv+7Wikipedia+7Wikipedia+7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Illustrative Example

Consider the case of complex line bundles:[Wikipedia+10arXiv+10Wikipedia+10](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14338v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- The second integral cohomology group H2(M;Z)H^2(M; \mathbb{Z})H2(M;Z) classifies complex line bundles over MMM.
- The differential cohomology group H^2(M)\hat{H}^2(M)H^2(M) classifies complex line bundles equipped with a connection.[arXiv+1Wikipedia+1](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14338v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here, the characteristic class map yields the first Chern class of the line bundle, while the curvature map provides the curvature 2-form associated with the connection.[arXiv+1arXiv+1](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14338v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Applications

Differential cohomology has significant applications in both mathematics and theoretical physics:

- **Mathematics**: It refines characteristic class theories, such as the Chern-Weil theory, by incorporating differential form data, leading to more nuanced invariants like the Chern-Simons forms.
- **Theoretical Physics**: In the quantization of abelian gauge fields, differential cohomology provides a natural language to describe gauge potentials (connections) and their associated field strengths (curvatures), ensuring a coherent treatment of both local and global aspects.[MathOverflow+3MathOverflow+3arXiv+3](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/222353/examples-of-differential-cohomology-in-cohesive-infty-topos?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14338v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
