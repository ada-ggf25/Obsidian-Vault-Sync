Short answer: **yes—and no**.

- If you mean **real normed division algebras** (nice “number systems” where every nonzero element has an inverse and the norm multiplicatively respects products), then by **Hurwitz’s theorem** the list stops at
    
    - R\mathbb{R} (1D) – commutative, associative
        
    - C\mathbb{C} (2D) – commutative, associative
        
    - H\mathbb{H} quaternions (4D) – non-commutative, associative
        
    - O\mathbb{O} octonions (8D) – non-commutative, **non-associative** (but alternative)  
        There is **nothing beyond 8D** with all those “nice” properties.
        
- If you relax the niceness, you can go higher via the **Cayley–Dickson construction**:
    
    - **Sedenions** (16D), then 32D, 64D, … But starting at 16D you get **zero divisors** (so not division algebras) and lose even alternativity.
        
- There are also broader frameworks in higher dimensions:
    
    - **Clifford (geometric) algebras** in any dimension (associative, very useful in physics/geometry) — but they’re not division algebras.
        
    - **Split** versions (e.g., split-octonions) are 8D but have an indefinite norm and zero divisors.
        

So: the “next one up” from quaternions in the classic ladder is the **octonions (8D)**. Beyond that you can go to higher dimensions, but you must give up key properties like division and/or associativity.
