Great question. Two key clarifications unlock it:

### 1) Does superposition itself make the future “more entropic”?

No. The **quantum dynamics** (Schrödinger evolution) are time-reversal symmetric and don’t, by themselves, create a time arrow. The reason the **past** is lower-entropy is the **low-entropy initial condition of the universe** (the “Past Hypothesis”). What superposition plus **decoherence** does is provide the _mechanism_ by which interactions spread information into the environment and produce stable **records**—which line up with the **thermodynamic arrow**. Decoherence piggybacks on the thermodynamic arrow; it doesn’t add a new, independent one.

### 2) Which has more entropy: a single electron in superposition or after “collapse”?

It depends what you’re counting and what you include in the system.

- **Isolated electron (no environment):**  
    Whether it’s in a superposition ∣ψ⟩|\psi\rangle or in an eigenstate, the state is **pure**. The von Neumann entropy S(ρ)=−Tr ρln⁡ρS(\rho)=-\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho\ln\rho is **0** in both cases.
    
- **Electron after measurement / decoherence (tracing out the environment):**  
    The electron’s _reduced_ state becomes a **mixed** state (e.g., a 50–50 mixture of outcomes). Now its von Neumann entropy is **> 0** (up to ln⁡2\ln 2 for a 50–50 two-outcome case). This is **entanglement entropy** created by interaction with the apparatus/environment.
    
- **Whole closed system (electron + apparatus + environment):**  
    If evolution is unitary (no objective collapse), the **global** state remains pure (entropy unchanged). The apparent entropy increase arises because we **ignore** the environment’s microdetails (coarse-graining) and look only at the subsystem.
    

> So: superposition **alone** doesn’t raise entropy; **entanglement with—and information flow into—the environment** does. That’s why past events (which have already interacted and decohered) leave records you can remember, while the future (which hasn’t) does not.

### A compact way to answer your original question with quantum language

We remember the past because past interactions have **decohered** into stable, redundant records in our environment (and brains), increasing entropy locally when we trace out the environment. The future hasn’t interacted with us yet, so there are **no records** to read. Superposition by itself isn’t what makes the future “higher entropy”; the **low-entropy past** plus **decoherence** and **coarse-graining** are.
