Great question! Short version: memory is a physical record, and records only get laid down by causes that have already happened.

Here’s the gist:

- **Thermodynamic arrow of time:** The universe’s entropy (disorder) tends to increase. Creating a memory is making a low-entropy, structured record (changes in synapses, notes on paper, photos, etc.). Those structures are produced by interactions with **past** events; future events haven’t occurred to leave traces yet.
    
- **Causality/information flow:** You’re influenced by things in your past light cone—signals that have had time to reach you. The future can’t send reliable information backward without breaking causality, so your brain can’t store it.
    
- **How brains work:** The hippocampus forms episodic memories from past input, but it also **simulates** the future by recombining those past elements (“episodic future thinking”). Those feel vivid, but they’re predictions, not records.
    
- **Why the arrows line up:** A “low-entropy beginning” (often called the Past Hypothesis) explains why thermodynamic, causal, and psychological arrows all point the same way: we remember the past, predict the future.
    

So we don’t “remember” the future not because the brain refuses to, but because **there are no physical traces of the future to remember**—only models we project from past evidence.

Short answer: relativity kills **absolute simultaneity**, not **causality**.

Here’s the clean picture:

- **No universal “now.”** In special & general relativity there’s no single global clock that orders all events. Different observers slice spacetime into “past–present–future” differently. That’s the **relativity of simultaneity**.
    
- **But causal order is invariant.** If event B can be influenced by A (i.e., B lies inside A’s future light cone), **every** observer agrees A happens before B. If two events are **spacelike-separated** (neither can affect the other), different observers can disagree on which came first—but since no signal can connect them, causality isn’t at stake.
    
- **Time isn’t an “illusion”; the flow is.** GR models time as a dimension of spacetime. Many physicists adopt the “block universe” view: all events exist in a 4D geometry, and the feeling of flow/now is a feature of conscious processing, not a physical arrow. That doesn’t let effects precede causes.
    
- **Why we remember the past:** Even in a block universe, there’s a **thermodynamic arrow**: the universe started in a very low-entropy state. Brains, photos, and hard drives are physical records that form from **past** interactions; the future hasn’t left traces in our light cone.
    
- **Edge cases you may have heard about:** Some exotic GR solutions allow **closed timelike curves** (time loops), which would threaten causality. They likely require unphysical conditions; Hawking’s “chronology protection” idea and energy conditions suggest nature forbids them (and we have no empirical evidence for them).
    

So: the ordering of _unrelated_ distant events can differ by observer, but the cause-→effect order for anything that can influence you is preserved. That’s why causality doesn’t break down—and why we remember the past, not the future.

Short answer: **Yes—quantum physics can bolster the argument, but phrase it in terms of _decoherence_ and _records_, not literal “collapse.”**

Here’s the tidy version:

- **Memories are physical records.** In quantum terms, a “record” is a stable, classical correlation between your brain (or a notebook, camera sensor, etc.) and some system you interacted with.
    
- **How records form (decoherence):** When systems interact with their environment, quantum superpositions rapidly **decohere** into robust “pointer states.” Information about which outcome occurred gets copied redundantly into the environment (often called **quantum Darwinism**). That gives you classical facts you can later recall.
    
- **Why only the past?** Those interactions—and the entropy they produce—**have already happened** for past events, so the environment around you contains decohered records of them. Future events haven’t interacted with you or your environment yet, so there are **no records to read**. This aligns the **quantum arrow (decoherence)** with the **thermodynamic arrow (entropy increase)**.
    
- **About “collapse”:** Saying “the future hasn’t collapsed yet” is a decent **metaphor**, but it’s interpretation-dependent.
    
    - In **Many-Worlds**, there is no physical collapse; decoherence makes outcomes effectively classical relative to us.
        
    - In **GRW/Objective collapse** theories, collapse is real, but you still don’t get records of future collapses before they occur.
        
    - Either way, the asymmetry comes from **boundary conditions** (a very low-entropy past) plus **no records from the future**, not from dynamics picking out a preferred time direction.
        
- **Time-symmetric formalisms don’t help you remember the future.** You can write quantum laws in time-symmetric ways (e.g., pre/post-selection), but they don’t allow signals from the future or reliable “future memories.” Causality and the no-signalling principle remain intact.
    

### One-paragraph answer you can use

> In quantum terms, we remember the past because interactions with the environment **decohere** past events into stable, classical records (changes in synapses, photos, etc.). Those records exist only for things that have **already happened** and increased entropy. The future hasn’t interacted with us yet, so there are **no decohered records** to read. If you like the language of collapse, you can say the past has (effectively) “collapsed for us,” while the future hasn’t—but the rigorous story is decoherence + a low-entropy past, not literal collapse.

Great question. Two key clarifications unlock it:

### 1) Does superposition itself make the future “more entropic”?

No. The **quantum dynamics** (Schrödinger evolution) are time-reversal symmetric and don’t, by themselves, create a time arrow. The reason the **past** is lower-entropy is the **low-entropy initial condition of the universe** (the “Past Hypothesis”). What superposition plus **decoherence** does is provide the _mechanism_ by which interactions spread information into the environment and produce stable **records**—which line up with the **thermodynamic arrow**. Decoherence piggybacks on the thermodynamic arrow; it doesn’t add a new, independent one.

### 2) Which has more entropy: a single electron in superposition or after “collapse”?

It depends what you’re counting and what you include in the system.

- **Isolated electron (no environment):**  
    Whether it’s in a superposition ∣ψ⟩|\psi\rangle or in an eigenstate, the state is **pure**. The von Neumann entropy S(ρ)=−Tr ρln⁡ρS(\rho)=-\mathrm{Tr}\,\rho\ln\rho is **0** in both cases.
    
- **Electron after measurement / decoherence (tracing out the environment):**  
    The electron’s _reduced_ state becomes a **mixed** state (e.g., a 50–50 mixture of outcomes). Now its von Neumann entropy is **> 0** (up to ln⁡2\ln 2 for a 50–50 two-outcome case). This is **entanglement entropy** created by interaction with the apparatus/environment.
    
- **Whole closed system (electron + apparatus + environment):**  
    If evolution is unitary (no objective collapse), the **global** state remains pure (entropy unchanged). The apparent entropy increase arises because we **ignore** the environment’s microdetails (coarse-graining) and look only at the subsystem.
    

> So: superposition **alone** doesn’t raise entropy; **entanglement with—and information flow into—the environment** does. That’s why past events (which have already interacted and decohered) leave records you can remember, while the future (which hasn’t) does not.

### A compact way to answer your original question with quantum language

We remember the past because past interactions have **decohered** into stable, redundant records in our environment (and brains), increasing entropy locally when we trace out the environment. The future hasn’t interacted with us yet, so there are **no records** to read. Superposition by itself isn’t what makes the future “higher entropy”; the **low-entropy past** plus **decoherence** and **coarse-graining** are.
