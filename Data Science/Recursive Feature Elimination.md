## Summary

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a wrapper-based feature selection technique that iteratively removes the least important features based on model coefficients or feature importance scores, aiming to select the optimal subset for predictive performance [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Starting with the full feature set, RFE fits an estimator (e.g., a linear model or decision tree), ranks features by importance, and then eliminates the lowest‑ranked features in each iteration until only the desired number remains [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Variants like RFECV integrate cross‑validation to automatically tune the number of features selected [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). RFE is implemented in libraries such as scikit‑learn and is valued for reducing overfitting, enhancing model interpretability, and improving computational efficiency, though it can be computationally expensive for very large feature sets [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rfe-feature-selection-in-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[datadance.ai](https://datadance.ai/machine-learning/recursive-feature-elimination-working-advantages-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Overview

### What Is RFE?

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a wrapper‑based feature selection algorithm that relies on an external estimator to assign importance weights to features and then recursively removes the least important ones until the target number of features is reached [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Purpose of RFE

RFE aims to select the features that contribute most to predictive performance by eliminating irrelevant or redundant variables, thus helping to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rfe-feature-selection-in-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). It is particularly useful when working with datasets that have many features but relatively few observations, where dimensionality reduction enhances both performance and interpretability [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/05/recursive-feature-elimination/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## How RFE Works

### Iterative Elimination Process

RFE starts by fitting the chosen estimator on the complete feature set and computing feature importance via model coefficients (for linear models) or importance scores (for tree‑based models) [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). It then removes a user‑specified number (or fraction) of the least important features—controlled by the `step` parameter—and refits the estimator on the reduced set. This elimination–refitting cycle continues until only the specified number of features remains [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Feature Ranking and Selection

At each iteration, RFE assigns a rank to every feature, with rank 1 indicating the most important feature. This ranking allows you to see the relative importance of all features, not just the ones selected [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Implementations and Variants

### scikit‑learn RFE

Scikit‑learn provides the `sklearn.feature_selection.RFE` class, which requires:

- `estimator`: any model that exposes `coef_` or `feature_importances_`,
- `n_features_to_select`: the target number of features,
- `step`: number (or fraction) of features to remove per iteration,
- `importance_getter`: method to extract feature importance. [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross‑Validation (RFECV)

The `RFECV` class extends RFE by adding a `cv` parameter for cross‑validation: it evaluates model performance across folds for varying feature counts and automatically selects the count that maximizes the cross‑validated score [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This helps avoid manual tuning and ensures robust feature selection [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/feature_selection/plot_rfe_with_cross_validation.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Advantages and Drawbacks

### Advantages

- **Handles high-dimensional data** and captures feature interactions, making it suitable for complex datasets [datadance.ai](https://datadance.ai/machine-learning/recursive-feature-elimination-working-advantages-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Model-agnostic**: works with any estimator that provides feature importances [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rfe-feature-selection-in-python/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Self‑tuning with RFECV**: automatically finds the optimal number of features via cross‑validation [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Drawbacks

- **Computational cost**: repeated model training can be expensive for large feature sets [datadance.ai](https://datadance.ai/machine-learning/recursive-feature-elimination-working-advantages-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Estimator‑dependent**: results vary with the choice of base model and can be unstable if features are highly correlated [skillcamper.com](https://www.skillcamper.com/blog/feature-selection-in-machine-learning-how-to-choose-the-best-features-for-your-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Univariate elimination**: at each step it removes the weakest features individually, which may overlook features that are jointly predictive [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/450518/rfe-vs-backward-elimination-is-there-a-difference?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## When to Use RFE

Use RFE when you need an interpretable model with a limited set of features—common in domains like bioinformatics for gene selection—where both predictive performance and feature transparency are crucial [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/05/recursive-feature-elimination/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). For extremely high-dimensional data, consider L1‑based methods (e.g., Lasso) or embedded approaches within tree ensembles for greater scalability [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-023-02010-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Example Code Snippet

```python
python
CopyEdit
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Base estimator
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Recursive Feature Elimination to select top 5 features
rfe = RFE(estimator=model, n_features_to_select=5, step=1)
rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Mask of selected features and their ranking
selected_mask = rfe.support_
feature_ranking = rfe.ranking_

```
