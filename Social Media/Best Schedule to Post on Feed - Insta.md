Curto e direto (hora PT/UK — é o mesmo fuso todo o ano). ([golisbon.com](https://www.golisbon.com/practical-lisbon/time-date.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Melhor dia/hora para ti (PT + UK, 18–25):**

→ **Sexta-feira às 15:00.** Estudos de 2025 com **2M+ posts** mostram que a **sexta às 15:00** é o pico de alcance; **quinta às 15:00** também é forte, mas fica ligeiramente atrás. ([buffer.com](https://buffer.com/resources/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

_(Nota: a Sprout Social vê os melhores blocos mais cedo (10:00–15:00) de segunda a quinta; entre as tuas duas opções, **sexta ganha**.)_ ([Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-instagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Quando divulgar nas Stories após publicar o feed:**

- **Primeiro teaser:** **+30–60 min** depois do post (ex.: publicas 15:00 → stories 15:30–16:00). Ajuda a captar quem não viu o feed e aproveita o sinal de **recência** no ranking.

- **Bónus na sexta:** uma segunda story **16:00–18:00** (alinha com os melhores horários de Stories à sexta). ([NapoleonCat](https://napoleoncat.com/blog/best-time-to-post-instagram-stories/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Se precisares de novo impulso:** mais uma story ao **início da noite (19:00–21:00)** — horários onde Gen Z tende a estar ativa. ([hopperhq.com](https://www.hopperhq.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Resumo executável:** posta **sextas às 15:00**; faz story **15:30–16:00**, opcional **~17:00**, e um último empurrão **à noite** se for um post importante.

Short answer: **yes — your best slot stays Friday ~15:00 (PT/UK time), with Thursday ~16:00 as runner-up**. That mix works well for your niches:

- **Lifestyle / going out** → Friday **14:00–16:00** performs in “media & entertainment,” with a Friday bump; your 15:00 hit sits right in that window. ([blog.hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/))
- **Entrepreneurship** → Finance/marketing verticals peak **late-morning to afternoon on Wed–Fri**; Friday **11:00–16:00** is strong—again covering your 15:00 post. ([blog.hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/))
- **Sports** → Engagement skews **afternoon→evening** and **around live events**. If it’s match-tied, post **30–60 min before kickoff** or at **halftime**; for evergreen sports content, late-afternoon or evening does best. ([Comscore, Inc.](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/The-Best-and-Worst-Times-for-Sports-Brands-to-Post-on-Social-Media?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Why I’m not moving you to weekends or early mornings: broad 2025 studies cluster Instagram wins on **weekday mid-afternoon** (Buffer: **15:00–18:00** on weekdays; Hootsuite shows Thurs/Fri afternoon peaks). Your Friday-15:00 plan is inside those peaks. ([buffer.com](https://buffer.com/resources/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [blog.hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/))

If you want a tiny tweak per topic:

- Nightlife teaser Reel or Story at **~18:00–19:00 Friday** to catch evening planners. ([blog.hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/))
- Entrepreneurship carousels also test well **Wed–Thu 12:00–14:00** as an additional slot, but keep **Fri 15:00** as your primary. ([blog.hootsuite.com](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/))

_(PT and UK share the same clock during DST and in winter, so one schedule fits both.)_ ([Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?p1=133&p2=136&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Bottom line: **Keep posting Friday ~15:00**; **Thursday ~16:00** is your backup. Add sports posts near game moments, and a Friday early-evening Story to amplify nightlife content.
