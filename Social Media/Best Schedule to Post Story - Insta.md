**15:45 (Portugal/UK time).**

Why this exact minute?

- Your primary feed time is **Friday 15:00**, and Buffer’s 2025 study pegs **Friday ~15:00** as a top-performing slot. ([Buffer](https://buffer.com/resources/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Posting the Story **~45 min later** hits the 30–60 min window, leveraging **recency** in Instagram’s ranking while letting the post gather initial comments/likes. ([creators.instagram.com](https://creators.instagram.com/grow/algorithms-and-ranking?locale=en_US&utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Instagram strategy guides also recommend **resharing new posts to Stories** to widen reach—timing it slightly later helps you capture a second wave of viewers. ([Dashboard de Marketing Social](https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-algorithm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

_(If you go with Thursday at 16:00 instead, use **16:40**.)_
