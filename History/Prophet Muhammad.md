Here’s the concise, historically grounded snapshot.

- **Who**: **Muhammad** (c. 570, Mecca – **8 June 632**, Medina) is the Arab prophet revered by Muslims as God’s final messenger (_“Seal of the Prophets”_), the founder of Islam, and the proclaimer of the Qur’an. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Muhammad | Biography, History, & Facts"), [corpus.quran.com](https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=33&verse=40&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Verse (33:40) - English Translation"))
    
- **Revelation**: At about **age 40** (c. 610), he reported receiving the first revelation via the angel **Jibrīl (Gabriel)** while in the **Cave of Ḥirāʾ** near Mecca; these revelations comprise the Qur’an. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Muhammad | Biography, History, & Facts"))
    
- **Mission in Mecca → Hijra**: After years of preaching strict monotheism amid opposition, he and early Muslims migrated in **622** to **Medina** (the **Hijrah**), an epoch that starts the Islamic calendar. There he led a community and state under the **Constitution of Medina**. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hijrah-Islam?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Hijrah | History, Definition, & Importance"))
    
- **Leadership in Medina**: He guided religious life and politics, facing the Meccan Quraysh in campaigns including **Badr (624)** and the **Trench (627)**, consolidating the nascent Muslim polity. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Badr?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Battle of Badr | History, Significance, & Facts"))
    
- **Later years & legacy**: After the **conquest of Mecca (630)** he performed the **Farewell Pilgrimage (632)** and died soon after. For Muslims, his **Sunnah** (normative example) preserved in **hadith**, together with the **Qur’an**, is the foundation of Islamic law and practice; the earliest full biographical traditions are associated with **Ibn Isḥāq** (surviving mainly via **Ibn Hishām**).

If you’d like, I can map his life to a tight timeline or explain how different source genres (Qur’an, hadith, sīra) are used by historians.
