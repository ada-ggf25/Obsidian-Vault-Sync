#law #religion 

Short answer: **Yes—mainly in family (personal-status) law.** Most other areas (criminal, commercial, civil, labour, etc.) apply the **same federal laws to everyone**, regardless of religion.

# Where the law splits

## 1) Family / personal-status

There are **two federal regimes** plus an Abu Dhabi-specific one:

- **For Muslims:** **Federal Decree-Law 41/2024 (Personal Status Law)** governs marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance, etc. It updates the former 2005 law and has been rolling into force during 2025. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/2770/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2024 On the Issuance of ..."), [roedl.com](https://www.roedl.com/insights/uae-new-personal-status-law-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE: The New Personal Status Law N' 41 for the year 2024"))
    
- **For non-Muslims (nationals and residents):** **Federal Decree-Law 41/2022 (Civil Personal Status Law)** creates a **secular, civil** framework for marriage, divorce (including no-fault), custody, inheritance and wills, and lets non-Muslims opt for their home-country law instead in many cases. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1586?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law On Civil Personal Status"))
    
- **Abu Dhabi only:** **Law 14/2021 (Non-Muslim Personal Status)** established **civil marriage and a dedicated civil family court** (bilingual procedures; English used widely) for non-Muslims in the emirate. ([Ministério da Justiça EAU](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/AR/Documents/non-muslims/Abu%20Dhabi%20Law%20No.%20142021%20On%20Personal%20Status%20for%20Non-Muslim%20Foreigners%20in%20the%20Emirate%20of%20Abu%20Dhabi.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Abu Dhabi Law No. 14/2021 On Personal Status for Non ..."))
    

The UAE government portal also explains, in plain language, that **non-Muslim family matters follow the civil regime**, while **Muslim family matters follow the Muslim personal-status law.** ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/marriages/personal-status-affairs-for-non-muslims?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil marriage | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))

### Typical differences you’ll see in practice (non-Muslim regime)

- **Civil marriage** with age/consent requirements (no guardian requirement). ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/marriages/personal-status-affairs-for-non-muslims?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil marriage | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **No-fault divorce** procedures and **joint-custody**–style concepts as defaults. ([Charles Russell Speechlys](https://www.charlesrussellspeechlys.com/en/insights/expert-insights/family/2025/non-muslim-divorce-in-the-uae-understanding-uae-divorce-law/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Non-Muslim Divorce in the UAE: Understanding ..."))
    
- **Inheritance & wills:** non-Muslims can set distribution by will; Dubai/RAK offer the **DIFC Courts Wills Service** for non-Muslim wills and probate. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/difc-courts-wills/services?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Service - DIFC Courts"))
    

## 2) Everything else (applies to everyone)

- **Criminal law:** The **Penal Code (Federal Decree-Law 31/2021)** applies **generally**. It contains some references to Sharia concepts (e.g., _diyah_ / blood-money) inside a codified framework, but it is **not a separate “Muslim vs non-Muslim” code.** ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://www.uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529?keyword=penal&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree Promulgating the Crimes and ..."), [uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree No. (31) of 2021 Promulgating the ..."))
    
- **Civil/commercial, companies, labour, procedures, evidence, etc.:** one set of federal laws for all. (Forum/language can differ, but not by religion.) ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE ..."))
    

## 3) Free-zone courts (neutral to religion)

In civil/commercial disputes inside the financial free zones:

- **DIFC Courts (Dubai)** and **ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi Global Market)** are **English-language, common-law** courts. They don’t apply religious status rules to contracts or torts; parties can even **opt in** by contract. (Separate from family cases.) For **wills**, the **DIFC Wills Service** is specifically for **non-Muslims**. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/difc-courts-wills/services?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Service - DIFC Courts"))

## Quick takeaway

- **Yes, there are different laws—but narrowly:** the **split is in family law** (Muslim PSL 41/2024 vs non-Muslim CPSL 41/2022, plus Abu Dhabi’s 14/2021).
    
- **No split elsewhere:** criminal, civil, commercial, labour, etc. are **one set of laws for all**.
    

If you tell me your scenario (marriage/divorce, custody, inheritance planning, or which court to use), I can map the exact pathway and documents you’d need under the right regime.
