Here’s the clean hierarchy, with where each court “sits” and who uses which track.

# 1) Two parallel pillars

**A. Federal judiciary (used by Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain)**

- **Apex:** **Federal Supreme Court** (Abu Dhabi) — constitutional court and final court of cassation for the federal track. Handles federal appeals and specific constitutional/conflict matters between emirates and the federation. ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution"), [uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"))
    
- **Middle tier:** **Federal Courts of Appeal.** ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE ..."))
    
- **First tier:** **Federal Courts of First Instance** (civil, commercial, administrative, labour, personal-status, criminal divisions). **Public Prosecution** forms part of the federal judiciary for investigations and prosecutions. ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/structure-of-the-judicial-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Structure of the judicial system"))
    

**B. Local (emirate) judiciaries (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah)**

- **Apex:** **Court of Cassation** (each emirate’s own).
    
- **Middle tier:** **Court of Appeal.**
    
- **First tier:** **Courts of First Instance** (subject-matter circuits similar to the federal track). ([adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/courtss.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Courts - Abu Dhabi"), [rak.ae](https://www.rak.ae/wps/portal/rak/government-entities/courts-department/RAK%2BCourts%2BDepartment?utm_source=chatgpt.com "RAK Courts Department"))
    

# 2) Who is on which pillar (today)

- **Local systems:** **Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah** run independent three-tier judiciaries ending in their **Court of Cassation**. ([adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/courtss.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Courts - Abu Dhabi"), [rak.ae](https://www.rak.ae/wps/portal/rak/government-entities/courts-department/RAK%2BCourts%2BDepartment?utm_source=chatgpt.com "RAK Courts Department"))
    
- **Federal system:** **Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain** use federal courts (appeals ultimately to the **Federal Supreme Court**). ([Chambers](https://chambers.com/articles/uae-judicial-system-explained-federal-and-local-level?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE Judicial System Explained: Federal and Local Level"))
    

# 3) What exactly the apex courts do

- **Federal Supreme Court** (federal pillar): final court on federal matters and **original jurisdiction** for constitutional disputes (e.g., emirate–federation conflicts) under the Constitution. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"))
    
- **Courts of Cassation** (local pillar): final courts for Abu Dhabi, Dubai and RAK on their local cases. ([adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/courtss.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Courts - Abu Dhabi"))
    

# 4) Free-zone courts (separate, commercial/civil only)

These sit **alongside** onshore courts and do **not** have criminal jurisdiction.

- **DIFC Courts (Dubai International Financial Centre)** — **English-language, common-law** courts: **Small Claims Tribunal → Court of First Instance → Court of Appeal**. Parties can **opt-in by contract** even without another DIFC link. No criminal jurisdiction. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"), [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/-/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/pdf/difcadgm_arbitration_guide_brochure.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Guide to litigation in the DIFC Courts and the ADGM Courts"))
    
- **ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi Global Market)** — **English common law applies directly** by regulation; structure is **Court of First Instance → Court of Appeal**. No criminal jurisdiction. ([Abu Dhabi Global Market](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"))

DIFC: Small Claims → CFI → Court of Appeal (opt-in jurisdiction; common law) ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OPT IN"))

If you want, I can tailor this into a “forum-selection cheat-sheet” (onshore federal vs. Abu Dhabi/Dubai/RAK vs. DIFC/ADGM) for contracts, enforcement, and language/translation implications.
