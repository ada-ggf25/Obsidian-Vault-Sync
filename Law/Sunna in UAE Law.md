[[Prophet Muhammad]]
# 1) What is “Sunnah” (Sunna)?

**Sunnah** is the Prophet Muhammad’s **normative example**—his _words, actions, and tacit approvals_—that Muslims treat as authoritative guidance. In Islamic legal theory (_uṣūl al-fiqh_), the Sunnah is a **primary source of Sharīʿa**, second only to the Qur’an; classical jurists (notably al-Shāfiʿī) systematised its legal authority through the recorded reports known as **ḥadīth**. In short: _Qur’an + Sunnah → Sharīʿa; juristic interpretation of them → fiqh._ ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sunnah?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Sunnah | Definition & Significance in Islam"))

# 2) How Sunnah figures in UAE law (the on-the-ground context)

The UAE is a codified (civil-law) system that gives **Sharīʿa** a defined role. Because **Sunnah is a core source of Sharīʿa**, it informs UAE law **indirectly** through the places where statutes point to Sharīʿa or fiqh—rather than via direct quotation of ḥadīth.

- **Constitutional anchor.** The Constitution declares _Islam is the official religion and Islamic Sharīʿa is a main source of legislation_. This frames how lawmakers draft and courts interpret statutes. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"))
    
- **Civil Code fallback & interpretation.**  
    **Article 1** of the Civil Transactions Law (the Civil Code) says that if no statutory text applies, the judge **adjudicates according to Islamic Sharīʿa**, looking first to the **Mālikī** and **Ḥanbalī** schools, then **Shāfiʿī** and **Ḥanafī**—i.e., to classical **fiqh** that itself is grounded in Qur’an and **Sunnah**. **Article 2** adds that the **rules and fundamentals of Islamic doctrine** guide interpretation; **Article 3** treats the **fundamental principles of Islamic Sharīʿa** as part of public policy. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1025?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree Law Concerning the Issuance of the Civil ..."))
    
- **Personal-status (family) law.** For Muslims, a new **Federal Decree-Law 41/2024** codifies marriage/divorce/custody/inheritance drawing on Sharīʿa (hence Sunnah). For non-Muslims there is a separate **civil regime (41/2022)**. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/2770/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2024 On the Issuance of ..."))
    
- **Criminal law touchpoint.** The Penal Code states that **qiṣāṣ** (retaliation) and **diyah** (blood money) are governed by **Islamic Sharīʿa**; other crimes are defined by code—again, Sharīʿa (and thus Sunnah) enters via statutory reference, not by direct citation. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree No. (31) of 2021 Promulgating the ..."))
    
- **Free-zone carve-outs.** In the **ADGM** and **DIFC** courts (financial free zones), civil/commercial cases are decided under **common law in English**, not by applying Sharīʿa; consequently Sunnah has **no operative role** there. ([en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"))
    

**Bottom line:** The UAE’s onshore courts apply **statutes first**; **Sunnah** shapes outcomes **through Sharīʿa and fiqh** wherever the Constitution and the Civil Code tell judges to use those sources (especially when legislation is silent or needs interpretation). In ADGM/DIFC, Sunnah does not apply because those courts use common law. ([en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"))

If you want, I can map specific scenarios (e.g., contract disputes vs. family cases) showing exactly when a UAE judge would reach for Sharīʿa/fiqh—and by extension the Sunnah.

Got it—here’s a practical “when-do-they-reach-for-Sharīʿa/fiqh (and thus the Sunnah)” map for UAE judges, by case type and forum. I’m focusing on _onshore_ courts first (where this really matters), then note DIFC/ADGM carve-outs.

# Quick map (onshore UAE courts)

**Key switch** (what sends a judge to fiqh):

- **Civil Code Art. 1.** If the Civil Code has no provision, the judge must adjudicate **according to Islamic Sharīʿa**, first choosing from **Mālikī** and **Hanbalī**, then **Shāfiʿī** and **Hanafī**; if still silent, **custom**, so long as it does not violate public order. Also, **fiqh is used to interpret** Code provisions. This is the explicit statutory trigger that pulls in fiqh (built on Qurʾān & **Sunnah**).
    
- **Personal Status Law (PSL) Art. 2.** In family cases for Muslims, judges **interpret by fiqh** and, when no text exists, decide by the four schools (in the order Mālik, Aḥmad, Shāfiʿī, Abū Ḥanīfa).
    
- **Constitution Art. 7.** Sharīʿa is a **main source of legislation** (background principle), and **public order** must not contradict definitive Sharīʿa rules in personal-status areas (Civil Code Art. 3). ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"))

## A) Family / personal status

**Muslim parties (marriage, divorce, custody, lineage, wills, inheritance):**

1. Judge applies **Federal PSL 28/2005**.
    
2. For interpretation and gaps, **PSL Art. 2** sends the judge to **fiqh** (four schools order).
    
3. Because fiqh rests on Qurʾān & Sunnah, **Sunnah becomes operative** via this reference.
    

**Non-Muslim parties (federal regime):**

- Since **Feb 2023**, **Decree-Law 41/2022 (Civil Personal Status)** governs non-Muslim marriage, divorce, inheritance, wills and parentage—and lets them **opt for their home law** (choice of law caveats aside). In these cases the judge **does not** reach fiqh/Sunnah. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1586/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2022 On the Civil Personal ..."), [Governo dos EAU](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/marriages/personal-status-affairs-for-non-muslims?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil marriage | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    

**Abu Dhabi’s civil family track (local regime):**

- **Abu Dhabi Law 14/2021** set up a **Civil Family Court** for **non-Muslims** (now with broadened scope by later amendments). Proceedings are secular; no resort to fiqh. ([adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/Pages/CivilFamilyCourt.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court"), [conflictoflaws.net](https://conflictoflaws.net/2024/abu-dhabi-court-of-cassation-on-civil-family-law-and-muslim-foreigners-has-the-tide-turned/?print=pdf&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Abu Dhabi Court of Cassation on Civil Family Law and ..."))
    

**Conflict-of-laws backstop you’ll see in orders:**

- **Civil Code Art. 17** and PSL Art. 1(2)-(3) govern which _national_ law applies in inheritance/marriage for foreigners; but **public order** remains a limit (cannot contradict definitive Sharīʿa rules in core personal status). ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1025/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law No. (5) of 1985 concerning the issuance of the ..."))
    

---

## B) Contracts & commercial disputes

**Ordinary civil contracts (non-merchant dealings):**

- Apply the **Civil Code**. If the Code is **silent/ambiguous**, **Art. 1** forces the judge to **fiqh** (and thus Sunnah via fiqh), before custom. Expect fiqh-coloured doctrines (e.g., gharar/uncertainty) to appear in reasoning when the black-letter Code runs out.
    

**Commercial transactions (merchant/commerce disputes):**

- Primary law is **Commercial Transactions Law 50/2022**. It **codifies interest** rules (e.g., Art. 72 allows contractual interest; if unstated, market rate **capped at 9%**; **no compound interest**). Because the commercial statute covers a lot, **judges rarely need fiqh** here; they stick to the statute and general civil-procedure/evidence codes. ([Governo dos EAU](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2024/Federal-Decree-by-Law-No-50-of-2022-Concerning-Promulgating-the-Commercial-Transactions-Law.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law No. (50) of 2022, Promulgating the ..."), [Akin - Akin, an Elite Global Law Firm](https://www.akingump.com/a/web/eQ4nWYSNoHxsUFzmKMjxoC/7JGgfZ/thought-leadership-commercial-transactions-law-v3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Five Key Updates to the UAE Commercial Transactions ..."), [moet.gov.ae](https://www.moet.gov.ae/en/-/ministry-of-economy-reviews-new-commercial-transactions-law-and-its-role-in-supporting-developing-uae-s-business-environment?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ministry of Economy & Tourism reviews new Commercial ..."))
    
- Note the **civil vs commercial loan** distinction the courts make: **civil interest-bearing loans are prohibited** under the Civil Code, but **commercial loans may carry interest** under the CTL—so whether a dispute is “commercial” can be outcome-determinative. ([legal500.com](https://www.legal500.com/developments/thought-leadership/charging-interest-on-loans-in-the-uae/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Charging interest on loans in the UAE"))
    

**Evidence & procedure:**

- Governed by **Evidence Law 35/2022** and **Civil Procedure** rules; these are modern codes. No automatic jump to fiqh unless a family-law statute sends you there. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1612?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law Promulgating Law of Evidence in ..."))
    

---

## C) Torts / civil liability, unjust enrichment, property, waqf

- These live in the **Civil Code**; if a novel issue isn’t covered, **Art. 1–2** push the court to **fiqh** for principles and interpretation (you’ll see classical treatise citations in judgments on waqf management, gifts, last-illness dispositions, etc.). **That** is where Sunnah can indirectly appear through fiqh maxims.
    

---

## D) Criminal law (qisās/diya and beyond)

- UAE criminal law is **codified** (Decree-Law 31/2021). Judges apply the Code.
    
- **Where Sharīʿa conditions for _qisās_ or _diya_ are met**, the Code **recognises those penalties**; if the Sharīʿa conditions are **not** met, the court applies the **statutory penalties** in the Code. (Art. 67(A) lists _qisās_ and _diya_; 67(B) tells courts to fall back on Code penalties if Sharīʿa conditions aren’t satisfied.) **Standard diya** for manslaughter is **AED 200,000** (modifiable by Cabinet). Here the **Sharīʿa framework explicitly governs**, so Sunnah may be part of the applied doctrinal test via fiqh.
    

---

## E) DIFC & ADGM (when Sharīʿa/fiqh is _not_ reached)

- These are **common-law** island jurisdictions for **civil/commercial** matters.
    
    - **ADGM:** **direct application of English common law** (including equity). ([adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"))
        
    - **DIFC:** applies its **own laws** and can apply parties’ chosen law; it also runs the **DIFC Wills Service** for **non-Muslims** (a route commonly used to avoid Sharīʿa forced-heirship on UAE assets). **Sharīʿa is not a source** for DIFC judges, except via UAE **public policy** at the enforcement interface. ([content.next.westlaw.com](https://content.next.westlaw.com/practical-law/document/I68bdbb68bad611e598dc8b09b4f043e0/The-DIFC-Courts?contextData=%28sc.Default%29&transitionType=Default&viewType=FullText&utm_source=chatgpt.com "The DIFC Courts | Practical Law"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/difc-courts-wills/services?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Service"))

# Bottom line (decision cues)

- **Muslim family status** → PSL → **fiqh** for interpretation/gaps → **Sunnah** operative via fiqh.
    
- **Non-Muslim family status** → **Decree-Law 41/2022** (or **Abu Dhabi Law 14/2021** in AD) → **no fiqh**. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1586/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2022 On the Civil Personal ..."), [adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/Pages/CivilFamilyCourt.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court"))
    
- **Civil contracts/torts** → Civil Code → **fiqh** only if the Code is silent/ambiguous (Art. 1–2).
    
- **Commercial** → CTL 50/2022 (interest allowed per statute; **no need to reach fiqh** unless a true lacuna). ([Governo dos EAU](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2024/Federal-Decree-by-Law-No-50-of-2022-Concerning-Promulgating-the-Commercial-Transactions-Law.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law No. (50) of 2022, Promulgating the ..."))
    
- **Criminal (homicide/bodily harm)** → Penal Code 31/2021 **with embedded qisās/diya** rules (Sharīʿa preconditions matter).
    
- **DIFC/ADGM** → **common law only** (Sharīʿa appears, if at all, as **UAE public policy** at recognition/enforcement). ([adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [clydeco.com](https://www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2023/01/public-policy-challenges-to-arbitration-awards-in?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Public policy challenges to arbitration awards in the United ..."))
    

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page flowchart—_“Is this a case where fiqh (hence Sunnah) applies?”_—with the exact statutory hooks (article numbers) at each decision box.
