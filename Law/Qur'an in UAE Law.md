[[Sharia in UAE Law]]
[[Sunna in UAE Law]]
[[UAE Law - Qisas and Diya]]

Short answer: **not usually by quoting the Qur’an directly, but yes via Sharia as a source.** Here’s how it works:

- **Constitutional baseline.** The UAE Constitution says _Islamic Sharia is a main (principal) source of legislation_ — it doesn’t require every statute to cite scripture. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"), [constituteproject.org](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Arab_Emirates_2004?utm_source=chatgpt.com "United Arab Emirates 1971 (rev. 2004) Constitution"))
    
- **Civil Code fallback to Sharia.** Article 1 of the Civil Transactions Law tells judges: if no statutory text applies, **adjudicate under Islamic Sharia**, looking first to Maliki and Hanbali fiqh, then Shafi‘i and Hanafi; if still no rule, apply custom. That’s an explicit Sharia pathway, not a verse-by-verse Qur’anic citation. ([Aceris Law](https://www.acerislaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/UAE-Civil-Code.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE-Civil-Code.pdf"), [mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/international-trade-amp-investment/115222/sharia-as-a-source-of-uae-law "Sharia as a Source of UAE Law - International Trade & Investment - United Arab Emirates"))
    
- **Criminal law carve-out.** The Penal Code states that **Qisas and Diya** matters are governed by Islamic Sharia; the rest is governed by the code. Again: Sharia is referenced, not Qur’anic verses. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree Promulgating the Crimes and ..."))
    
- **Family/personal status.** For Muslims, the new **Federal Decree-Law 41/2024** codifies personal-status rules derived from Sharia. For **non-Muslims**, a separate civil regime (Federal Decree-Law 41/2022) applies. These statutes are modern codes; they don’t quote the Qur’an. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/2770/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2024 On the Issuance of the ..."), [charlesrussellspeechlys.com](https://www.charlesrussellspeechlys.com/en/insights/expert-insights/family/2025/non-muslim-divorce-in-the-uae-understanding-uae-divorce-law/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Non-Muslim Divorce in the UAE: Understanding UAE Divorce Law"))
    
- **Onshore vs. common-law courts.** Outside the financial free zones, courts are civil-law based with the Sharia fallback above. In **ADGM** and **DIFC**, courts apply **English common law** and do **not** apply Sharia/Qur’anic sources. ([en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"))
    
- **Direct “Qur’an” mentions in legislation are rare.** Where the word appears, it’s mostly in laws regulating **Qur’an memorisation centres** and religious administration, not in civil, commercial or criminal codes. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1966/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law No. (1) of 2018 Regarding Holy Quran ..."), [uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://www.uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1964?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cabinet Resolution Concerning the Executive Regulation ..."))
    

So, UAE laws **incorporate Sharia as a source** (which, by definition, draws from the Qur’an and Sunnah) — but **the statutes themselves generally don’t cite specific Qur’anic verses.**
