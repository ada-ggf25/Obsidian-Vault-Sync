[[Sunna in UAE Law]]
[[English Common Law]]
# What “Sharia” means

**Sharia (sharīʿa)** is Islam’s revealed law—God’s will for human conduct as derived above all from the **Qur’an** and the **Sunnah** (the Prophet’s teachings and practice). Classical jurists then **interpreted** that revelation into human‐made rules called **fiqh**. In other words: _Sharia = divine source; fiqh = jurists’ interpretations of it._ ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sharia?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Sharia | Definition, Law, & Countries"), [oxfordreference.com](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100012392?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Islamic Law"), [guides.law.columbia.edu](https://guides.law.columbia.edu/c.php?g=1221841&p=9280464&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Primary Sources of Islamic Law"))

# How Sharia fits into UAE law

The UAE is a **codified, civil-law system** that gives Sharia a defined role through the Constitution and key statutes:

1. **Constitutional status.** The UAE Constitution states: _“Islam is the official religion … [and] Islamic Shari’a is a main source of legislation.”_ This sets the policy baseline for lawmakers and courts. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/constitution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates"))
    
2. **Civil Code “fallback” & interpretation.**
    
    - **Civil Transactions Law (1985)**—Article 1 instructs judges: if no legislative provision applies, **decide according to Islamic Sharia**, looking first to the **Maliki** and **Hanbali** schools (then **Shafi‘i** and **Hanafi** if needed).
        
    - **Article 2** adds that **rules of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)** are relied on when **construing and interpreting** the Code.
        
    - **Article 3** includes a public-order safeguard “not to conflict with the **definitive provisions and fundamental principles of Islamic Shari’a**.”
        
3. **Personal-status (family) law.**
    
    - For **Muslims**, the **new Federal Decree-Law 41/2024** codifies marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance, etc., drawing on Sharia. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/2770/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2024 On the Issuance of ..."))
        
    - For **non-Muslims**, **Federal Decree-Law 41/2022** creates a **civil personal-status regime** (with an option in some cases to apply the person’s home-country law). The federal government’s portal explains scope and options. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1586/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2022 On the Civil Personal ..."), [u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/marriages/personal-status-affairs-for-non-muslims?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil marriage | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
        
4. **Criminal law touchpoint.** The **Penal Code (31/2021)** lists **qiṣāṣ and diyah** (retaliation and blood money) among principal penalties **where Sharia’s conditions are met**; otherwise the code’s secular penalties apply. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://www.uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529?keyword=penal&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree Promulgating the Crimes and ..."))
    
5. **Where Sharia does _not_ apply.** Inside the two financial free zones:
    
    - **ADGM Courts** apply **English common law directly** under the Application of English Law Regulations 2015.
        
    - **DIFC Courts** are **common-law, English-language** courts applying DIFC statutes and common-law principles in civil/commercial matters. These forums do not apply Sharia to decide civil/commercial disputes. ([en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"))
        

## Practical takeaways

- Onshore UAE courts apply **codes first**; **Sharia guides interpretation** and supplies rules **only when the statute is silent** (especially via Civil Code arts. 1–3).
    
- **Family law** is split by **religious status** (Muslim vs. non-Muslim) under separate federal laws. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/2770/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (41) of 2024 On the Issuance of ..."))
    
- **Criminal law** is codified but recognises **qiṣāṣ/diyah** in the limited circumstances defined by Sharia and the Penal Code. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://www.uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529?keyword=penal&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree Promulgating the Crimes and ..."))
    
- **ADGM/DIFC** operate on **common-law** foundations (no Sharia) for civil/commercial cases. ([adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"))
    

If you tell me your use-case (e.g., contract drafting, family matters, or choosing between onshore vs ADGM/DIFC courts), I can sketch the exact implications and forum choice in a quick decision tree.
