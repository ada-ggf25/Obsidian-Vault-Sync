# What are DIFC and ADGM?

They’re the UAE’s two **financial free zones** with their **own courts** and commercial laws, designed for cross-border business. Crucially, both operate in **English** and on a **common-law** foundation.

- **DIFC Courts (Dubai International Financial Centre)**  
    Civil/commercial courts created by Dubai law, independent from Dubai’s onshore judiciary. They can hear: (a) DIFC-related disputes, and (b) disputes where parties **opt in by contract**, even without another link to the DIFC. Model opt-in clauses are provided by the court.

- **ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi Global Market)**  
    Built explicitly on **English common law**. By regulation, **English common law (including equity)** applies **directly** in ADGM for civil/commercial matters (subject to ADGM statutes). This is set out in the **Application of English Law Regulations 2015**.

## Why businesses pick them

- **Precedent & predictability** (common-law method).
    
- **English-language procedures** familiar to international parties.
    
- **Opt-in jurisdiction** (especially DIFC), so you can choose the forum in your contracts. [DIFC Courts+1](https://www.difccourts.ae/opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

If you want, I can sketch a one-page clause pack (choice of court + governing law + arbitration fallback) tuned for **DIFC vs ADGM** trade-offs.
