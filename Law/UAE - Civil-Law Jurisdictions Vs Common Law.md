# UAE-specific note (since you asked about it earlier)

- **Onshore UAE** follows a **civil-law** model (codes + Sharīʿa references in particular fields).
    
- **ADGM** directly applies **English common law (including equity)** “as it stands from time to time,” so English precedent is a live source. **DIFC** runs a **common-law** system via DIFC statutes and case law (not wholesale English law), with its own courts and growing body of precedent.

# Practical consequences you’ll notice

- **Litigation strategy.** In common law, you live and die by appellate **precedent** and distinguishing it; in civil law, the code article and its doctrinal construction come first, with consistent case lines as strong reinforcement.

- **Drafting contracts.** Expect background **good-faith** controls in civil-law jurisdictions; in common law, manage duties through express clauses (good faith, best efforts, reasonableness) if you want that effect.

- **Procedure & proof.** Civil-law judges may take a more proactive role in directing evidence; common-law litigation leans on party-driven discovery and cross-examination. [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/inquisitorial-procedure?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

If you want, I can tailor this to **forum-shopping choices** (e.g., how a non-compete, interest clause, or limitation of liability will fare across civil- vs common-law seats, including onshore UAE vs DIFC/ADGM) with concrete clause language and risk notes.
