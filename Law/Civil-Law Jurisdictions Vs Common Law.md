[[UAE - Civil-Law Jurisdictions Vs Common Law]]

Here’s a crisp, comparative map of **civil-law** versus **common-law** systems—with the big structural differences, typical jurisdictions, and a few practical consequences you’ll actually feel in litigation and transactions.

# What they are (in one paragraph each)

**Civil law (a.k.a. Romano-Germanic/continental law).** The world’s most widespread legal family. Core method: comprehensive **codes** (civil code, commercial code, criminal code, etc.) as primary sources; case law is influential but formally secondary. Intellectual roots: Roman law (Justinian’s _Corpus Juris Civilis_), 19th-century codifications like the **Napoleonic Code (1804)** and **German BGB (1900)**. Judges apply and systematise the code; appellate courts promote uniformity but don’t create binding precedent in the common-law sense (though lines of decisions—_jurisprudence constante_—carry real weight). ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/civil-law-Romano-Germanic?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil law | History, Systems, & Facts"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil law (legal system)"), [gesetze-im-internet.de](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "German Civil Code BGB"), [law.gmu.edu](https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/04-15.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Judicial Precedents in Civil Law Systems"))

**Common law.** Originated in medieval England; core method: judge-made **case law** developed through **binding precedent** (_stare decisis_), alongside statutes. Hierarchical precedent (vertical and, to varying degrees, horizontal) is central; top courts may depart from their own decisions in narrow circumstances.

# Core contrasts (and convergence)

- **Primary sources & hierarchy.**  
    Civil law: codes/statutes are primary; case law is persuasive, with consistency promoted via _jurisprudence constante_. Common law: prior **ratios** of higher courts bind lower courts under **stare decisis**. Modern practice shows convergence (civil-law high courts publish guiding decisions; common-law jurisdictions codify heavily), but the starting posture differs.

- **Judicial role & procedure.**  
    Civil law is historically **inquisitorial** in criminal/civil procedure (judges lead fact-finding); common law is **adversarial** (party-led proof, judge as umpire). Most systems are now mixed, but the procedural DNA still shows. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/inquisitorial-procedure?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Inquisitorial procedure | Adversarial, Accused Rights & ..."), [unodc.org](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-9/key-issues/adversarial-vs-inquisitorial-legal-systems.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adversarial versus Inquisitorial Legal Systems"))
    
- **Contract law “good faith”.**  
    Civil law codes typically impose a **general good-faith duty** (e.g., **BGB §242**), shaping performance, interpretation, and often pre-contractual dealings; common law traditionally lacks a general clause, recognising narrower duties via case law and specific contexts—though there’s incremental convergence.

- **How precedent actually works.**  
    Common law: binding, with detailed reporting and ratio/obiter distinctions. Civil law: no formal binding force, but stable lines of decisions are strongly persuasive (_jurisprudence constante_), and high courts steer uniformity.

# Who uses which?

- **Civil law (illustrative):** France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, and most of Latin America and continental Europe (plus many parts of Africa/Asia). ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/civil-law-Romano-Germanic?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil law | History, Systems, & Facts"))
    
- **Common law (illustrative):** England & Wales, most of the U.S. (except Louisiana for much private law), Canada (except Quebec for private law), Australia, India, Singapore, Hong Kong.

- **Mixed systems are common:** e.g., **Scotland** (civilian roots with common-law overlay) and **South Africa** (Roman-Dutch private law with English procedural/public-law influences).
