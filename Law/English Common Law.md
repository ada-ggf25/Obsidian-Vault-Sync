#law 

English common law is the body of law developed by the courts of England (today, England & Wales) from the Middle Ages onward. Instead of being set out in a single code, it grows case-by-case through judicial decisions and recorded custom; those decisions then guide later courts through precedent (stare decisis). This judge-made tradition spread to many countries (e.g., the U.S. and much of the Commonwealth).

# What makes it “common law”?

- **Precedent (stare decisis).** Lower courts are bound by legal principles (the **ratio decidendi**) in prior decisions of higher courts; non-essential remarks (**obiter dicta**) are persuasive only. This doctrine promotes consistency and predictability. ([iclr.co.uk](https://www.iclr.co.uk/knowledge/glossary/ratio-decidendi/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ratio decidendi"))
    
- **Court hierarchy matters.** In England & Wales, precedents flow down the hierarchy; the Supreme Court (since 2009, replacing the House of Lords) _may_ depart from its own past decisions “when it appears right to do so,” a limited discretion rooted in the 1966 Practice Statement and reaffirmed by the UK Supreme Court. ([publications.parliament.uk](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldinfo/ld08judg/redbook/redbk45.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "House of Lords - Practice Directions Applicable to Criminal ..."), [supremecourt.uk](https://supremecourt.uk/how-to-appeal/non-portal-pd4?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Non portal Practice direction 04 - UK Supreme Court"))
    
- **Custom and incremental reasoning.** Rules emerge and are refined across cases rather than enacted wholesale in codes. ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Common law | Definition, Origins, Development, & Examples"))
    

# Relationship to statutes and to equity

- **Statute vs common law.** Parliament legislates via Acts and delegated legislation; courts interpret and apply those statutes and fill gaps with common-law principles. The UK has no single written constitution; much constitutional principle resides in statute _and_ the common law. ([Courts and Tribunals Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/our-justice-system/jud-acc-ind/justice-sys-and-constitution/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The justice system and the constitution"))
    
- **Law and equity were administered separately until the late 19th century.** The **Judicature Acts 1873–1875** reorganised the courts, allowing all divisions to grant legal and equitable remedies in one forum (substance remained distinct, but procedure fused). ([parliament.uk](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/court/overview/judicatureacts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicature_Acts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Judicature Acts"))
    

# Today’s scope (examples)

Common law remains foundational in private law (contract, tort, property) and parts of criminal law. For instance, **murder and manslaughter** are still common-law offences (modified by statute but not defined by it).

# How it differs from civil-law systems

Civil-law jurisdictions (e.g., much of continental Europe) rely on comprehensive codes, with judicial decisions typically not binding as formal sources of law. Common-law systems centre on binding precedent and case reports. ([UC Berkeley Law](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "THE COMMON LAW AND CIVIL LAW TRADITIONS"), [ppp.worldbank.org](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/legislation-regulation/framework-assessment/legal-systems/common-vs-civil-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Key Features of Common Law or Civil Law Systems"))

If you like, I can sketch the English court hierarchy and show exactly how precedent flows (who binds whom), or walk through a worked example—e.g., how the murder definition you often see in textbooks arose purely from common-law cases.
