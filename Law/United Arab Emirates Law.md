[18:33, 8/7/2025] Francisco Serrano: "Although the core principles of law in the UAE are drawn from Sharia, most legislation is comprised of a mix of Islamic and European concepts of civil law, which have a common root in the Egyptian legal code established in the late 19th to 20th centuries."

[18:39, 8/7/2025] Francisco Serrano: "The basis of the legal system in the UAE is Sharia or Quranic Law. In the constitutions, Islam is identified as the state religion as well as the principal source of law. However, although the principles of Sharia influence criminal and civil laws, the direct influence of Sharia in the UAE is primarily confined to social laws, such as family law, divorce, or succession. Most commercial matters are now dealt with by either civil courts or permanently established arbitration tribunals."

# The UAE legal (juridic) system — a deep, structured overview

Below is a practitioner-style map of how law is **made**, **organised**, and **applied** in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including federal vs. local courts, specialist common-law courts (DIFC/ADGM), sources of law, core codes (civil, commercial, criminal, procedure, evidence), prosecutors, language rules, and dispute-resolution options. I’ve cited official UAE portals and court websites throughout so you can verify details.

## 1) Constitutional and federal structure

**Federation and dual judiciary.** The UAE is a federal state of seven emirates. Each emirate may either join the **federal judiciary** or run a **local (emirate-level) judiciary** for matters not expressly assigned to the federation. As of today, **Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain** use the federal courts; **Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah** maintain their own court systems (including courts of cassation). ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution"))

**Top federal court.** At the federal level, the **Federal Supreme Court** sits in Abu Dhabi and decides constitutional questions, conflicts of jurisdiction between emirates and federation, and other matters under the Constitution. (The emirates with local judiciaries have their own courts of cassation that act as their highest courts.) ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))

**Legal family.** The UAE is a mixed system: **civil law + Sharia** (with **common-law** applied inside two financial free zones—DIFC and ADGM). The Constitution recognises **Islamic Sharia as a principal source of legislation**; most codes are civil-law style and historically influenced by Egyptian/French codifications. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution"))

---

## 2) Sources of law and the main federal codes

**Hierarchy (simplified).** Constitution → Federal laws/decree-laws and emirate laws (where competent) → Regulations/decisions → Custom/Sharia principles (where codes refer). The **Civil Transactions Law** (the civil code) sets general private-law rules. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))

**Core codes in force (selected):**

- **Personal status (non-Muslims, federal)** — Federal Decree-Law **41/2022** (civil personal status for non-Muslims). Abu Dhabi also runs a separate non-Muslim regime (see §6).

## 3) Court architecture and jurisdiction

### 3.1 Federal pathway (in 4 emirates)

Three tiers: **Court of First Instance → Court of Appeal → Federal Supreme Court** (cassation). These courts have civil, commercial, administrative, labour, personal-status and criminal circuits. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))

### 3.2 Local (emirate) judiciaries (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, RAK)

Each has a three-tier system ending in a **Court of Cassation** (not the Federal Supreme Court). They mirror the same subject-matter circuits. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution"), [adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/courtss.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Courts - Abu Dhabi"))

**Examples:**

- **Abu Dhabi Courts**: First Instance, Appeal, **Cassation** (ADJD). ([adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/pages/courtss.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Courts - Abu Dhabi"))
    
- **Dubai Courts**: First Instance, Appeal, **Cassation** (Dubai Courts). ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Courts**: First Instance, Appeal, **Cassation** (RAK Courts). ([courts.rak.ae](https://courts.rak.ae/en/pages/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "RAK-Courts"))
    

### 3.3 Specialist “free-zone” common-law courts

**DIFC Courts (Dubai):** English-language, common-law courts (Court of First Instance, Court of Appeal, Small Claims Tribunal). **Opt-in** jurisdiction lets parties agree in writing to litigate in DIFC even with no DIFC connection (Article 5(A)(2) of the Judicial Authority Law). Protocols with Dubai Courts govern allocation/enforcement. No criminal jurisdiction. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"), [Baker McKenzie InsightPlus](https://insightplus.bakermckenzie.com/bm/dispute-resolution/united-arab-emirates-the-validity-and-enforcement-of-unilateral-jurisdiction-clauses-under-difc-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "United Arab Emirates: The validity and enforcement of ..."))

**ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi):** English-language courts applying **English common law directly** (Application of English Law Regulations 2015), with **opt-in** jurisdiction available by agreement. Recent appellate judgments reaffirm direct, “evergreen” adoption of English case law. ([adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [clearygottlieb.com](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/-/media/files/alert-memos-2023/abu-dhabi-global-markets-highest-court-confirms-english-law-cases-are-directly-enforceable.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM's Highest Court Upholds the Direct Enforceability of ..."))

**Cross-enforcement.** DIFC⇄Dubai Courts have long-standing Protocols/MoUs for jurisdiction and enforcement (2009). In **Jan 2025**, **ADGM Courts and onshore Dubai Courts** signed an MoU for **reciprocal enforcement of judgments**, simplifying onshore/offshore recognition. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/memoranda/judicial/protocol-of-jurisdiction-between-the-difc-courts-and-the-dubai-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Protocol of Jurisdiction between the DIFC Courts and ..."), [gtlaw.com](https://www.gtlaw.com/-/media/files/insights/alerts/2025/3/gt-alert_adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments.pdf?rev=cd5534d3232947fcb86cabc1df3b3905&utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))

---

## 4) What each court actually hears (subject-matter)

- **Personal Status (family)**: marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance. Historically Sharia-based for Muslims; now governed by the 2024 federal personal-status law for Muslims and by special civil regimes for non-Muslims (federal 41/2022, and Abu Dhabi’s non-Muslim law). **Mandatory family guidance/conciliation** often precedes trial. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Civil & Commercial**: contracts, tort, property, IP, companies, banking, bankruptcy, etc. The **Commercial Transactions Law 50/2022** applies to commercial matters. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Labour**: private-sector workplace disputes under **Federal Decree-Law 33/2021** (with Cabinet Reg. 1/2022). Fees are waived for employee claims up to AED 100k. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Criminal**: prosecutions are brought by the **Public Prosecution** under the **Penal Code 31/2021** and **Criminal Procedure 38/2022**. Cyber offences fall under **34/2021**. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"), [uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1529?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law by Decree Promulgating the Crimes and ..."), [bwcimplementation.org](https://bwcimplementation.org/sites/default/files/resource/UAE_CriminalProcedureCode.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law No. (38) of 2022, Promulgating the ..."))
    

---

## 5) Prosecutors, police, and the criminal track

**Public Prosecution** (federal or emirate-level) investigates and prosecutes. Police must refer complaints promptly; prosecutors must question an accused within **24 hours** and then order release or detention (Criminal Procedure). **Dubai Public Prosecution** and **Abu Dhabi Public Prosecution** publish structures and services. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/litigation-procedures/criminal-cases-/role-of-police-and-public-prosecution?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Role of police and Public Prosecution"), [dxbpp.gov.ae](https://www.dxbpp.gov.ae/default.aspx?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Dubai Public Prosecution"), [adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/EN/Pages/Prosecution0218-2117.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "About the Public Prosecution - Abu Dhabi"))

---

## 6) Family law — Muslims and non-Muslims

- **Muslims**: a **new Federal Personal Status Law (41/2024)** supersedes the 2005 law; it governs marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance, etc., with Sharia-based rules codified.
    
- **Non-Muslims (federal)**: **Federal Decree-Law 41/2022** introduced a **civil personal-status regime** for non-Muslims nationwide (marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc.). ([Global Law Experts](https://globallawexperts.com/uae-personal-status-law-comparative/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE Personal Status Law Comparative"))
    
- **Abu Dhabi’s dedicated non-Muslim system**: **Law No. 14/2021** creates English-language, civil procedures for non-Muslim family matters within ADJD (special courts/procedures).
    

---

## 7) Language of the courts and translation

**Default:** **Arabic is the official language** in onshore UAE courts; documents must be in Arabic or accompanied by a **MOJ-approved legal translation**. **Article 5** of the **Civil Procedure Code 42/2022** now allows designated circuits to run entirely in **English** (by decision of the federal or local judicial head) — a limited but important reform. DIFC and ADGM already operate in English. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1602/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (42) of 2022 Promulgating the ..."), [u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/litigation-procedures/civil-cases-?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil cases | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"), [adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"))

---

## 8) Civil procedure, evidence and enforcement — how cases run

- **Civil Procedure 42/2022** modernised case-management, filings, service, appeals timelines, small-claims thresholds, and gave a framework for English-language circuits. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1602/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (42) of 2022 Promulgating the ..."))
    
- **Evidence 35/2022** codifies burden of proof, witness/expert practice, electronic evidence, etc. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1612/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law No. (35) of 2022, Promulgating the ..."))
    
- **Enforcement**: Judgments are enforced through court **Execution Departments**. Foreign judgments and arbitral awards are enforced subject to treaties (e.g., **New York Convention** for arbitration; UAE acceded in **2006**), domestic statutes, and—in Dubai/Abu Dhabi—protocols/MoUs with DIFC/ADGM courts. ([Convenção de Nova Iorque](https://www.newyorkconvention.org/contracting-states/contracting-states/united-arab-emirates?utm_source=chatgpt.com "United Arab Emirates"), [DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/memoranda/judicial/protocol-of-jurisdiction-between-the-difc-courts-and-the-dubai-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Protocol of Jurisdiction between the DIFC Courts and ..."), [gtlaw.com](https://www.gtlaw.com/-/media/files/insights/alerts/2025/3/gt-alert_adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments.pdf?rev=cd5534d3232947fcb86cabc1df3b3905&utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))
    

---

## 9) Arbitration & ADR

- **Arbitration law**: Federal Law **6/2018** (UNCITRAL-style) governs UAE-seated arbitration and recognition/enforcement. The UAE is a party to the **New York Convention**. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1069/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Law No. (6) of 2018 Concerning Arbitration"), [u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/litigation-procedures/alternative-methods-to-settle-disputes-/uae-federal-law-on-arbitration?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE federal law on arbitration"))
    
- **Institutions**: **DIAC** (new Rules **2022**), ADGM Arbitration Regulations **2015** (updated), plus other centres. Courts (including ADGM/DIFC) support interim measures and award enforcement. ([diac.com](https://www.diac.com/en/adr-services/arbitration/rules/diac-arbitration-rules-2022/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "DIAC Arbitration Rules 2022"), [en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/arbitration-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arbitration Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"))
    

---

## 10) The legal profession & representation

- **Who may appear?** Onshore UAE courts generally require **UAE-national advocates** licensed and on the **Ministry of Justice** roll to conduct rights-of-audience. Foreign lawyers commonly act as **legal consultants** and may appear in **DIFC/ADGM Courts** if registered there. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/litigation-procedures/civil-cases-/appointment-of-attorneyslawyers-?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Appointment of attorneys/lawyers"))
    
- **Regulation.** **Federal Decree-Law 34/2022** overhauled lawyer and legal consultancy regulation (licensing, ethics, firm forms, foreign branches, training). MOJ runs e-services for lawyer registration. Dubai has separate registration for legal consultants; ADJD operates rolls including foreign-lawyer registers. ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1566/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree by Law No. (34) of 2022 Regulating the ..."), [moj.gov.ae](https://www.moj.gov.ae/en/home.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Homepage - Ministry of Justice - UAE"), [adjd.gov.ae](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/en/Pages/Registration-of-Foreign-Lawyers.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Registration of Foreign Lawyers - Abu Dhabi"))

## 11) Practical pointers (how it plays out)

- **Pick your forum early.** For international contracts, parties often **choose DIFC or ADGM Courts** (opt-in) or arbitration to obtain English-language procedure and common-law tools; onshore courts are faster for some execution routes and summary processes (e.g., cheques/instruments under CPL). ([Baker McKenzie InsightPlus](https://insightplus.bakermckenzie.com/bm/dispute-resolution/united-arab-emirates-the-validity-and-enforcement-of-unilateral-jurisdiction-clauses-under-difc-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "United Arab Emirates: The validity and enforcement of ..."))
    
- **Language logistics.** If you litigate onshore, budget for **certified Arabic translations** of pleadings and evidence, unless your case falls into a designated English-language circuit. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/litigation-procedures/civil-cases-?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Civil cases | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Enforcement planning.** For cross-border or onshore/offshore matters, plan how you’ll **move judgments/awards between DIFC/ADGM and onshore courts**, using the 2009 DIFC–Dubai Protocols and the **2025 ADGM–Dubai MoU** to your advantage. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/memoranda/judicial/protocol-of-jurisdiction-between-the-difc-courts-and-the-dubai-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Protocol of Jurisdiction between the DIFC Courts and ..."), [gtlaw.com](https://www.gtlaw.com/-/media/files/insights/alerts/2025/3/gt-alert_adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments.pdf?rev=cd5534d3232947fcb86cabc1df3b3905&utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))

## 12) One-page hierarchy (at a glance)

- **Federal:** First Instance → Appeal → **Federal Supreme Court** (for emirates in the federal system). ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE Government"))
    
- **Local (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, RAK):** First Instance → Appeal → **Court of Cassation**. ([u.ae](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution"))
    
- **Free zones:** **DIFC Courts** (English/common law; opt-in) and **ADGM Courts** (English common law directly; opt-in). **No criminal** jurisdiction. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/difc-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal framework"), [adgm.com](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"))

Want me to tailor this to a specific use-case (e.g., how to choose between onshore, DIFC, ADGM for a contract, or how to enforce a foreign judgment or award in the UAE)? I can turn it into a decision tree with steps and typical timelines.
