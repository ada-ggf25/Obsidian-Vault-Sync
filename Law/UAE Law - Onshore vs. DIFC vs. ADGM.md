Got it — here’s a practical “pick-your-forum” guide for the UAE. It’s centred on whether you _want binding precedent_ (stare decisis) to govern your dispute, but I’ll also flag the knock-on effects (language, disclosure, enforcement, and opt-in mechanics).

# At a glance

- **Onshore UAE courts (federal + local onshore courts in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, RAK):** _Civil-law system; no binding precedent._ Earlier rulings can be persuasive but don’t bind later panels. (A narrow Dubai exception exists for **jurisdictional conflicts** decisions issued by the new tribunal created in 2024 — those become binding “judicial principles”, but this doesn’t convert onshore courts into a precedent system generally.) ([Kennedys Law](https://kennedyslaw.com/en/thought-leadership/article/2025/why-without-prejudice-matters-developments-in-the-uae/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Why 'without prejudice' matters - developments in the UAE"), [K&L Gates](https://www.kslaw.com/news-and-insights/uae-courts-recognise-the-without-prejudice-principle-with-wide-reaching-implications-across-the-middle-east?utm_source=chatgpt.com "UAE Courts recognise the “Without Prejudice” principle ..."), [Dubai Government Digital Library](https://dlp.dubai.gov.ae/Legislation%20Reference/2024/Decree%20No.%20%2829%29%20of%202024%20Concerning%20the%20Judicial%20Committee%20for%20Resolving%20Conflicts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Decree No. (29) of 2024 Concerning the Judicial Committee ..."))
    
- **DIFC Courts (Dubai free zone):** _Common-law courts in English_ with **stare decisis**; parties can **opt in** by contract (use their model clause). Strong cooperation with Dubai Courts for jurisdiction allocation and mutual enforcement. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OPT IN"))
    
- **ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi Global Market):** _English common law applies **directly**_; **stare decisis**; parties can **opt in** by agreement. ADGM has MOUs for reciprocal enforcement with onshore courts, including a 2025 MoU with **Dubai Courts**. ([Abu Dhabi Global Market](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"), [ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/english-common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The English Common Law System"), [Greenberg Traurig](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/3/adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))
    

# Decision guide (what to choose and why)

### Choose **DIFC** if you want:

- **Binding precedent/common-law reasoning** to guide outcomes. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OPT IN"))
    
- **English-language procedure** and **common-law tools** (e.g., structured document production under the RDC). ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/rules-decisions/rules/part-28?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Part 28"))
    
- **Simple opt-in by contract** (before or after a dispute) using court-published clauses. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/download_file/view/543/4653?utm_source=chatgpt.com "difc courts opt in clauses for"))
    
- **Dubai-centric enforcement** pathways (long-standing protocols with Dubai Courts for jurisdiction and mutual enforcement). ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/memoranda/judicial/protocol-of-jurisdiction-between-the-difc-courts-and-the-dubai-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Protocol of Jurisdiction between the DIFC Courts and ..."))
    

### Choose **ADGM** if you want:

- **Direct application of English common law** (no “transposition” needed) and **stare decisis** within ADGM. ([Abu Dhabi Global Market](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"))
    
- **Opt-in jurisdiction** even without an ADGM physical nexus (agreement in writing suffices). ([ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/faqs/courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | ADGM Courts"))
    
- **English-language process** with ADGM Court Procedure Rules akin to English CPR. (ADGM publishes its Rules and Practice Directions.) ([ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/legislation-and-procedures?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts' Legislation and Procedures"))
    
- **Cross-border recognition** helped by ADGM’s MOUs with Abu Dhabi/RAK, and **a 2025 MoU with onshore Dubai Courts** for reciprocal enforcement. ([ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/memoranda-of-understanding?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts' Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)"), [Greenberg Traurig](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/3/adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))
    

### Choose **onshore UAE courts** if you want:

- **Civil-law, code-driven adjudication** with **no general stare decisis** (predictability comes from statutes and persuasive higher-court trends, not binding case law). ([Kennedys Law](https://kennedyslaw.com/en/thought-leadership/article/2025/why-without-prejudice-matters-developments-in-the-uae/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Why 'without prejudice' matters - developments in the UAE"))
    
- **Arabic as default language** (with limited English-language circuits now permitted by the 2022 Civil Procedure Code reforms). ([uaelegislation.gov.ae](https://uaelegislation.gov.ae/en/legislations/1602/download?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federal Decree-Law No. (42) of 2022 Promulgating the ..."), [dianahamadelaw.ae](https://dianahamadelaw.ae/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2022_UAE_Civil_Procedures_Law_pdf-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "2022 UAE Civil Procedures Law - Diana Hamade"))
    
- **Tighter document production** than common-law discovery (no broad “standard disclosure”; production is targeted/exception-based). ([horizlaw.ae](https://www.horizlaw.ae/insights/there-duty-disclose-documents-course-litigation-under-uae-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Is there a Duty to Disclose Documents in the Course of Litigation ..."), [twobirds.com](https://www.twobirds.com/-/media/new-website-content/pdfs/disputes-plus-know-how-briefs/rules-of-evidence--in-the-united-arab-emirates-overview.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Rules of Evidence (Civil Proceedings) in the United Arab Emirates"))
    
- **Matters only onshore courts can hear**: criminal and most family/personal-status claims (DIFC/ADGM are civil/commercial only).
    

# A few fine points that often swing the choice

- **How much do you want precedent to control?**
    
    - If **yes**, go **DIFC** or **ADGM**. Both are common-law, in English, and their internal hierarchies apply binding case law. ADGM’s framework even **imports English common law directly**. ([Abu Dhabi Global Market](https://en.adgm.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/application-english-law-regulations-2015-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Application of English Law Regulations 2015 | Rulebook"))
        
    - If **no / neutral**, onshore is fine; just remember there’s **no binding precedent**, aside from the **Dubai conflicts tribunal’s rulings** on _jurisdictional_ points since **Decree 29/2024**. ([Dubai Government Digital Library](https://dlp.dubai.gov.ae/Legislation%20Reference/2024/Decree%20No.%20%2829%29%20of%202024%20Concerning%20the%20Judicial%20Committee%20for%20Resolving%20Conflicts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Decree No. (29) of 2024 Concerning the Judicial Committee ..."), [K&L Gates](https://www.kslaw.com/news-and-insights/enhancing-jurisdictional-clarity-dubais-new-judicial-authority?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Enhancing Jurisdictional Clarity: Dubai's New Judicial ..."))
        
- **Opt-in mechanics (contract drafting):** both **DIFC** and **ADGM** allow **opt-in by agreement**; the **DIFC** even publishes model clauses you can paste into contracts. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/opt?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OPT IN"), [ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/faqs/courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | ADGM Courts"))
    
- **Evidence & disclosure:** if you need **common-law-style document production**, **DIFC/ADGM** are better; onshore disclosure is narrower and court-directed. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/rules-decisions/rules/part-28?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Part 28"), [horizlaw.ae](https://www.horizlaw.ae/insights/there-duty-disclose-documents-course-litigation-under-uae-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Is there a Duty to Disclose Documents in the Course of Litigation ..."))
    
- **Enforcement planning:** DIFC↔Dubai has mature **jurisdiction/enforcement protocols**; **ADGM** has MOUs with Abu Dhabi/RAK and, since **Jan 2025**, a **reciprocal enforcement MoU with onshore Dubai Courts**. Build this into your forum selection. ([DIFC Courts](https://www.difccourts.ae/about/memoranda/judicial/summary-of-the-protocol-of-enforcement-between-the-difc-courts-and-the-dubai-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the protocol of enforcement between the ..."), [ADGM](https://www.adgm.com/adgm-courts/memoranda-of-understanding?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts' Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)"), [Greenberg Traurig](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/3/adgm-courts-and-dubai-courts-sign-memorandum-on-reciprocal-enforcement-of-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ADGM Courts and Dubai Courts Sign Memorandum on ..."))
    
- **Language & user experience:** **DIFC/ADGM** run in **English**; onshore is **Arabic-first** (translation costs/time). Limited English-language circuits exist onshore since **CPL 42/2022**. ([dianahamadelaw.ae](https://dianahamadelaw.ae/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2022_UAE_Civil_Procedures_Law_pdf-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "2022 UAE Civil Procedures Law - Diana Hamade"))
    

# Quick clause tip (if you want precedent)

Use an **opt-in jurisdiction clause** to send disputes to **DIFC** or **ADGM**. For DIFC, start from the **official model** and tailor the governing law/enforcement paragraph for your deal.

If you share your scenario (type of contract, counterparty location/assets, need for interim relief, preferred governing law), I’ll draft a tight **forum-selection pack** (jurisdiction + governing law + enforcement notes) with the pros/cons for **onshore vs. DIFC vs. ADGM** for _your_ dispute profile.
