[[English Common Law]]
# Common law (in a nutshell)

**Common law** is a legal system where much of the law comes from **judgesâ€™ decisions** (case law) that bind later cases (**stare decisis**), originating in medieval England and now used in the UK, US, and many others. Statutes still matter, but courts develop and refine rules through precedent. [Encyclopedia Britannica+1](https://www.britannica.com/topic/common-law?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
