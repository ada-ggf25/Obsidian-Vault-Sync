You mean the **Court of Cassation**. In plain terms:

- **What it is (generally):** the **highest appellate court** in a civil-law system that reviews **points of law only**. It does **not** re-try facts; instead, it checks whether lower courts **applied the law correctly**. If there’s an error, it can **quash (cassate)** the judgment and usually **send the case back** to a lower court to be decided in line with its legal ruling. ([judiciariesworldwide.fjc.gov](https://judiciariesworldwide.fjc.gov/question/what-cassation?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Cassation? - Judiciaries Worldwide"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_cassation?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Court of cassation"))
    
- **In the UAE (onshore courts):**
    
    - In **Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Ras Al Khaimah**, the Court of Cassation is the **top court** of each emirate’s local judiciary. It hears challenges to **Court of Appeal** judgments **on law only** (e.g., misinterpretation/misapplication of law, jurisdictional errors, inadequate reasons).

    - On the **federal track** (used by Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain), the **Federal Supreme Court** plays the analogous “cassation” role for federal cases and also handles certain **constitutional/jurisdiction** disputes.

- **Key UAE features to know:**
    
    - **Scope of review:** cassation is for **legal errors**, not factual re-weighing. The UAE’s official portal stresses appeals here are “on points of law alone.” ([UAE](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-judiciary/the-system-of-courts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The system of courts | The Official Portal of the UAE ..."))
        
    - **Deadlines/thresholds:** for many civil/commercial matters, a cassation appeal must be filed **within 60 days** from the appeal judgment, typically where claims exceed specified thresholds. (See the UAE government portal for current thresholds and timing.)

    - **Organisation example:** Abu Dhabi’s Court of Cassation is structured into chambers (criminal, commercial, personal-status, administrative, civil, labour, etc.).

If you’d like, I can sketch a quick flow showing **First Instance → Appeal → Cassation/Federal Supreme Court** for each emirate vs. the federal system, and when a case is eligible to go up on cassation.
