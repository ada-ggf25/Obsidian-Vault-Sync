Short answer: **mostly no—except in the DIFC and ADGM courts, and a narrow Dubai-specific carve-out.**

- **Onshore UAE courts (federal + emirate courts such as Dubai/Abu Dhabi “onshore”)** are civil-law based and **do not follow binding judicial precedent (no stare decisis).** Earlier decisions—especially from the Courts of Cassation or the Federal Supreme Court—are persuasive and often followed in practice, but they are **not binding** on later panels.

- **DIFC Courts (Dubai free-zone, common-law):** operate under a common-law method and **apply a doctrine of precedent**—lower courts are bound by higher-court decisions; the Court of Appeal will only depart from its own rulings in limited circumstances.

- **ADGM Courts (Abu Dhabi free-zone, common-law):** English common law (including **stare decisis**) applies **directly**. The ADGM Court of Appeal has expressly confirmed that the **doctrine of precedent** forms part of the ADGM legal framework and governs how English case law binds the ADGM courts.

- **New, narrow Dubai exception (since 2024):** For **conflicts-of-jurisdiction issues** between DIFC Courts and other Dubai judicial bodies, **Decree No. 29 of 2024** makes the New Judicial Committee’s decisions set **binding “judicial principles”** that Dubai courts (including the DIFC Courts) must follow. This does **not** create general onshore stare decisis beyond that context.

If you want, I can map when to pick **onshore vs. DIFC vs. ADGM** depending on whether you want precedent to govern your dispute.
