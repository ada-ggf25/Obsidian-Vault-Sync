Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and responsibility in an indifferent or even absurd universe. It challenges traditional notions of objective meaning, asserting that individuals must create their own purpose through authentic living.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Core Principles of Existentialism

### 1. Existence Precedes Essence

Jean-Paul Sartre famously stated that "existence precedes essence," meaning that individuals are not born with a predetermined purpose. Instead, people define themselves through their actions and choices. This stands in contrast to essentialist views that assign inherent meaning or purpose to human life.

### 2. Freedom and Responsibility

Existentialism posits that humans are fundamentally free to make their own choices. However, this freedom comes with the burden of responsibility for the consequences of one's actions. There is no external authority to blame; individuals are accountable for shaping their own lives.

### 3. Authenticity

Living authentically involves embracing one's freedom and making choices that reflect one's true self, rather than conforming to societal expectations or external pressures. Authenticity requires self-awareness and a commitment to living in accordance with one's values.

### 4. Angst and Despair

Confronting the freedom to choose and the absence of inherent meaning can lead to feelings of anxiety (angst) and despair. These emotions arise from the realization that individuals are solely responsible for imparting meaning to their lives.

### 5. The Absurd

The concept of the absurd highlights the conflict between humans' search for meaning and the universe's apparent indifference. Albert Camus explored this in "The Myth of Sisyphus," suggesting that acknowledging the absurd can lead to personal freedom and a deeper appreciation of life.
