## üìò Major Works

### **The Prince (Il Principe)**

Written around 1513, _The Prince_ offers pragmatic advice to rulers on acquiring and maintaining power, often advocating for realpolitik over moral considerations. Key themes include:‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Virt√π and Fortuna**: The interplay between a leader's skill (_virt√π_) and the unpredictability of fate (_fortuna_).‚Äã
    
- **The Ends Justify the Means**: A ruler must be prepared to act immorally when necessary to maintain the state.‚Äã
    
- **Better to Be Feared Than Loved**: While both are desirable, fear is more reliable than love in securing obedience.‚Äã
    

These ideas challenged the prevailing moral and political doctrines of the time, leading to widespread debate and the eventual banning of the book by the Catholic Church.‚Äã

### **Discourses on Livy**

In contrast to _The Prince_, this work analyzes the structure and benefits of republican government, drawing lessons from the Roman Republic. Machiavelli discusses the importance of civic virtue, the role of conflict in political life, and the mechanisms for maintaining liberty.‚Äã
