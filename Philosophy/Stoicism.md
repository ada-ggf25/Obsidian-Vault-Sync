**Stoicism** is an ancient Greek philosophy that offers a practical framework for achieving tranquility, resilience, and moral clarity. Founded by **Zeno of Citium** around 300 BCE, Stoicism teaches that by aligning our will with nature and focusing on what we can control, we can attain a flourishing life‚Äîwhat the Greeks called _eudaimonia_.[Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia+2Wikipedia+2The Australian+2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## üß≠ Core Principles of Stoicism

### 1. **Dichotomy of Control**

Stoics distinguish between what is within our control (our thoughts, actions, and attitudes) and what is not (external events, others' opinions). Focusing on the former leads to inner peace.

### 2. **Virtue as the Highest Good**

Virtue‚Äîcomprising wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance‚Äîis considered the sole true good. External factors like wealth or health are "indifferents" and do not determine happiness.[The Australian+1Wikipedia+1](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/be-more-stoic-this-guru-thinks-so/news-story/e7be7dc9be337d2d325b003e3f674c1f?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. **Living According to Nature**

This entails understanding the natural order and our role within it, acting rationally, and fulfilling our duties to society.

### 4. **Emotional Resilience**

Stoicism teaches that destructive emotions arise from faulty judgments. By correcting our perceptions, we can achieve _apatheia_‚Äîa state of equanimity.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
