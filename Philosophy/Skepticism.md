**Skepticism** is a philosophical approach that questions the possibility of certain or absolute knowledge. It challenges the reliability of our beliefs, perceptions, and reasoning, urging a critical examination of what we claim to know.‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## üß† Core Concepts of Philosophical Skepticism

### 1. **Suspension of Judgment (_Epoch√©_)**

Skeptics often advocate for _epoch√©_, the suspension of judgment regarding knowledge claims. This approach maintains that, in the absence of definitive evidence, withholding belief is the most rational stance.‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2. **Fallibility of Human Perception and Reason**

Skepticism highlights the fallibility of human senses and reasoning. Since our perceptions can be deceptive and our reasoning flawed, skeptics argue that we should be cautious in accepting any knowledge claim as certain.‚Äã[Wikipedia+1Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. **The Problem of the Criterion**

This problem questions the standards by which we judge the validity of knowledge. If we need a criterion to evaluate knowledge, but we also need knowledge to establish that criterion, we face a circular dilemma, leading to skepticism about our ability to know anything with certainty.‚Äã

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Development

### **Ancient Skepticism**

- **Pyrrhonism**: Founded by Pyrrho of Elis, this school of thought advocates for suspending judgment to achieve mental tranquility (_ataraxia_). Pyrrhonists argue that for every argument, an equal and opposite argument exists, making certainty impossible.‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia+1Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Academic Skepticism**: Associated with Plato's Academy, this form asserts that knowledge is unattainable and that we should withhold assent from all beliefs.‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

### **Modern Skepticism**

- **Ren√© Descartes**: Employed methodological skepticism, doubting all beliefs that could be subject to even the slightest doubt, to establish a foundation for certain knowledge. This led to his famous conclusion, "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am").‚Äã
    
- **David Hume**: Questioned the principles of causality and induction, arguing that our beliefs about cause and effect are not grounded in reason but in habit and experience.‚Äã

## ‚öñÔ∏è Critiques of Skepticism

Skepticism faces several criticisms:‚Äã

- **Self-Refutation**: The claim that "nothing can be known" is itself a knowledge claim, potentially undermining the skeptic's position.‚Äã[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Practical Impracticality**: Living entirely without beliefs is unfeasible; we must operate on some assumptions to function in daily life.‚Äã
    
- **Paralysis by Analysis**: Excessive skepticism can lead to inaction, as constant doubt may prevent decision-making and progress.‚Äã
