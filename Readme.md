# My Obsydian Vault Sync

Well, you tried to use the Git plugin for Obsidian so you wouldn’t have to pay for Obsidian’s proprietary Sync service to keep your vault in sync across devices. You’d use GitHub as cloud storage, and your Obsidian vault would work like any other GitHub repository, using standard Git operations to sync across devices. However, after a few hours you ran into several problems with this approach (so it’s probably not worth trying again). Many users have also complained that the plugin’s automated Git actions weren’t working properly.

That led you to adopt the same process as the plugin but without the automation: you perform the Git actions manually while still treating your Obsidian vault as a GitHub repository to sync across devices. This way, you don’t need the problematic plugin, and everything still works.
