​In Obsidian's Graph View, the size, color, and linking distances of nodes are influenced by various factors, including the number of connections a note has, its tags, and user-defined settings.​

### Node Size

The size of a node typically reflects its connectivity within your vault. Notes with more links to and from other notes appear larger, indicating their centrality in your knowledge graph.​

### Node Color

Node colors can be customized based on tags, folders, or other metadata. For instance, you can assign specific colors to notes with certain tags or those residing in particular folders, helping to visually categorize your notes.​

### Linking Distance

The distance between nodes is determined by the strength of their connections. Notes that are more closely related or frequently linked tend to appear nearer to each other, while less connected notes are spaced further apart.​

Additionally, Obsidian allows for further customization through community plugins and CSS snippets. These tools enable you to fine-tune the appearance of your graph, including adjusting node sizes, colors, and link distances to better suit your preferences.​
