### ðŸŽ¨ Customizing Node Colors in Obsidian's Graph View

#### 1. **Using Built-in Settings**

Obsidian allows you to assign colors to nodes based on tags or folders directly through its settings:â€‹

To configure these settings:â€‹

2. Click on the **Filters** button (usually represented by a funnel icon).â€‹
    
3. Under the **Groups** section, you can add new groups based on tags or folders and assign specific colors to them.â€‹
    

This method provides a straightforward way to visually categorize your notes without additional plugins.â€‹

#### 2. **Using Community Plugins**

For more advanced customization, community plugins like **Juggl** offer enhanced graph visualization features:â€‹
