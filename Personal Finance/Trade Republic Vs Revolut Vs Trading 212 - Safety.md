Great question. “Safest” depends on **what wrapper your money sits in**. Here’s the safety ladder for **Revolut, Trading 212, and Trade Republic** (Portugal/EEA), focusing on protection if the firm failed—not market ups/downs.

# Safety ladder (from strongest protection → less)

1. **EU bank deposits covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS)** – up to **€100,000 per bank, per person**
    
    - **Revolut Bank UAB** (your EUR **current account** and **Instant Access Savings**) are insured by Lithuania’s DGS up to **€100k**. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
        
    - **Trade Republic cash** held at partner **EU banks** (Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan SE, etc.) is protected up to **€100k** per partner bank. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-sk/743-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
        
    - **EU rule**: the **€100k** level is harmonised across the EU. ([European Banking Authority](https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/depositor-protection/deposit-guarantee-schemes-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Guarantee Schemes data | European Banking Authority"))
        
2. **Uninvested cash placed in money-market funds (MMFs/QMMFs) via your broker** – **not a deposit**, very low risk but **no DGS**
    
    - Trading 212’s “**Interest on cash**” may place part of your balance in **QMMFs**; those units are investments (not deposit-insured). Some cash may still sit at banks (which _is_ DGS-covered); the split is shown in-app. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/interest-on-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Earn high interest on your uninvested cash"))
        
    - Trade Republic may diversify some balances into **liquidity funds** for IBAN users in certain countries; these are **segregated assets** (property of clients) but **not covered by deposit insurance**. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-sk/743-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
        
3. **Brokerage assets (stocks/ETFs/bonds)** – **your property**, held segregated at custodians; **market risk applies**
    
    - If the broker failed to return assets, the **investor compensation scheme** helps up to **€20k** for **Trading 212 (Cyprus/EEA)** and **Germany’s EdW** for Trade Republic (limits apply). This does **not** protect against market losses. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007315158-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
        
4. **Flexible Cash Funds at Revolut (the ~2.98% USD rate you mentioned)** – **money-market funds** held with **Revolut Securities Europe UAB**, **not a bank deposit**
    
    - Covered by Lithuania’s **Liabilities to Investors Insurance Scheme up to €22k** if the firm fails to safeguard assets; **no deposit guarantee** and the NAV can move slightly. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/accounts/difference-between-instant-access-savings-and-flexible-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings vs Flexible Cash Funds"))
        
5. **Crypto at brokers (Revolut/TR)** – **not covered** by DGS or investor compensation if the crypto itself loses value or is hacked; you rely on the provider/custodian
    
    - Revolut states crypto **isn’t** protected by the investor scheme. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-AT/legal/crypto-risk-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Risk Summary | Revolut Austria"))
        
    - Trade Republic highlights that **crypto-assets fall outside** the legal compensation/deposit guarantee framework. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-fr/crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto. With a bank."))

## What’s “safest” for you right now

- For **parking cash** with maximum protection: keep it as **EUR deposits** in a **DGS-insured bank** (e.g., **Revolut Bank UAB EUR current/Savings** up to €100k, or TR cash that’s sitting at partner banks). This is the top rung of protection. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
    
- Your current **Revolut USD 2.98%** is likely in **Flexible Cash Funds** (MMFs). That’s **very low risk**, but **not deposit-insured**; only **€22k investor scheme** applies. If “safest” is your priority, consider **moving USD→EUR** on a weekday (to avoid Revolut’s weekend FX markup) and parking in **Instant Access Savings** (DGS-insured). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/accounts/difference-between-instant-access-savings-and-flexible-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings vs Flexible Cash Funds"))
    
- For **Trading 212 “interest on cash”**: check the app’s **Interest on Cash** tab. Amounts held **at banks** are DGS-covered; amounts in **QMMFs** are **not** (they’re investments). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/money-protection?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Funds and data protection"))
    

### Quick rules of thumb

- **Emergency fund / “sleep-well” cash** → **DGS-insured deposits** (Revolut Bank UAB EUR; TR partner-bank EUR). ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
    
- **Cash you want to earn a bit more on** and you accept tiny market movements → **MMFs/QMMFs** (Revolut Flexible, T212 Interest on cash), knowing it’s **not** deposit-insured. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/interest-on-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Earn high interest on your uninvested cash"))
    
- **Investments (stocks/ETFs/gold ETCs)** → safe from **broker insolvency** due to **segregation**, but **market risk** is yours; investor compensation limits **€20k** (EEA). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007315158-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
    
- **Crypto** → **highest counterparty risk** at brokers; **no DGS/ICF** cover for asset losses. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-AT/legal/crypto-risk-summary/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Risk Summary | Revolut Austria"))
    

If you want, tell me how much of your cash you want **at maximum safety** vs **earning a bit more**, and I’ll suggest an exact split (e.g., “€X in Revolut Instant Access Savings, €Y at TR partner banks, €Z in MMFs”) with the protections each part has.
