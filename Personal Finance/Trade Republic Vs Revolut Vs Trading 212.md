[[Trade Republic Vs Revolut Vs Trading 212 - Safety]]

Awesome — let’s lock in a **safety-first, low-fee** plan tailored to your setup (Revolut today; no paid tiers; buys ≥ €500–€1,000; US stocks + ETFs; add some gold + crypto).

# The core rules (why these choices)

- **Fund brokers only by SEPA from Revolut.** Card/Apple/Google Pay into **T212** is free only up to a **€2,000 lifetime** allowance, then **0.7%**; **Trade Republic (TR)** also supports **SEPA transfers** (free) and may charge for card top-ups. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007139838-What-are-the-fees-for-funding-my-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for funding my account?"))
    
- **US shares: T212 vs TR** — T212 is **€0 commission** with **0.15% FX** on USD-priced trades; TR is **€1 per order**. **Break-even ≈ €667**: below that, T212 is cheaper; above that, TR wins. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))
    
- **US ETFs:** as an **EEA retail** investor you **can’t buy US-domiciled ETFs** (PRIIPs/KID). Use **EU-domiciled UCITS ETFs** that track US indices (e.g., iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS “SXR8”, IE00B5BMR087), ideally **EUR-listed** to avoid FX at T212. ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/us-domiciled-etfs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "US-domiciled ETFs: why they are no longer available from ..."))
    
- **Gold:** pick a **physically-backed EUR-traded ETC** (e.g., WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold **JE00B588CD74**, TER ~0.15%). **T212 = €0 commission** (and €0 FX if EUR line); **TR = €1/order**. Avoid Revolut commodities on Standard (**0.99% per buy/sell**, min fee). ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=JE00B588CD74&utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold | A1DCTK"))
    
- **Crypto:** **TR = €1/trade** (cheap at your size) but **no on-chain deposits/withdrawals**; **Revolut** supports some withdrawals but fees are **tiered (Standard typically 1.49%)**. For buy-and-hold cost, **TR wins**; for self-custody, use Revolut (or a dedicated exchange). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))
    
- **Parked cash safety:**
    
    - **Deposit-insured (safest):** _Revolut Bank UAB_ deposits (EUR **Instant Access Savings/current account**) up to **€100k** per person. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
        
    - **Broker cash yields:** **TR ~2.00% p.a.** on EUR cash (paid monthly; partner-bank DGS up to €100k); **T212 pays interest** and may place cash in **banks and/or QMMFs** (MMFs are **not DGS-insured**). ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
        
    - **Revolut Flexible Cash Funds (your 2.98% USD):** **money-market funds** via Revolut Securities Europe UAB — **not a bank deposit**; covered by **Lithuania’s investor scheme up to €22,000** (investment risk excluded). ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/flexible-cash-funds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Maximise your Funds | Grow your Money Online"))
        
- **Avoid weekend FX at Revolut:** Standard plan charges **1%** on weekend exchanges; do FX **Mon–Fri**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))

# What to do **now** with your two pots

## A) **€300** you want to invest (US stocks, US-tracking ETFs, gold, crypto)

**Funding (no fees):** Revolut → **SEPA EUR** → T212 and/or TR (don’t use card top-ups). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007139838-What-are-the-fees-for-funding-my-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for funding my account?"))

**Cheapest placements at €300 tickets:**

- **US stock / US-tracking ETF (UCITS)** → **T212** (≈ **€0.45** FX at 0.15%; €0 commission). Pick **UCITS** funds tracking US markets (e.g., **SXR8** on Xetra in **EUR**) to minimise or eliminate FX. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))
    
- **Gold** → **T212** with a **EUR-listed** physical ETC (e.g., **JE00B588CD74**). Commission **€0**. ([Börse Frankfurt](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/etf/wisdomtree-physical-swiss-gold-etc?utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold ETC ETC | A1DCTK"))
    
- **Crypto** → **TR** (flat **€1/trade**). If splitting €300 four ways creates multiple small orders/fees, consider **rotating monthly** (e.g., this month stocks+ETF on T212; next month crypto on TR; then gold, etc.). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))
    

> Mini break-evens you can rely on: **€667** (US shares T212 vs TR), **gold**: T212 (EUR line) usually **€0** vs TR **€1**, **crypto**: TR **€1** vs Revolut **~1.49%**. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))

## B) **$756** currently at ~**2.98%** in Revolut (USD Flexible Cash Funds)

Pick between **maximum safety** vs **slightly higher yield**:

- **Max safety:**
    
    1. On a **weekday**, convert **USD→EUR** inside Revolut (avoid the 1% weekend markup). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
        
    2. Move to **Revolut Instant Access Savings (EUR)** — **DGS-insured €100k**. Park there until you deploy into ETFs/stocks. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
        
- **Squeeze more yield (accept MMF risk/no DGS):**
    
    1. **SEPA EUR** to **T212**, then (if you want to keep dollars) convert inside T212 (**0.15% FX**).
        
    2. Enable **“Interest on cash”** in EUR or USD (T212 holds cash at **banks and/or QMMFs**; QMMFs are **not deposit-insured**). Check current in-app rates. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))

# Ongoing plan (buy & hold, ≥ €500–€1,000 orders)

|Bucket|App|How to buy with minimal fees|
|---|---|---|
|**US shares**|**T212** for orders **< €667** (0.15% FX); **TR** for **≥ €667** (€1/order). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))||
|**US-tracking ETFs (UCITS)**|**T212**. Use **EUR-listed UCITS** (e.g., **SXR8**, IE00B5BMR087) — €0 commission and **no FX**. (You can’t buy US-domiciled ETFs in the EEA.) ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/us-domiciled-etfs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "US-domiciled ETFs: why they are no longer available from ..."))||
|**Gold**|**T212** (EUR-listed physical **ETC**, e.g., **JE00B588CD74**; TER ~0.15%), or **TR** if you prefer (€1/order). Avoid Revolut commodities (**0.99%/side** on Standard).

## Concrete next steps (zero/low fees)

1. **Convert on weekdays** in Revolut (skip weekend FX). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
2. **SEPA** € transfers from Revolut to **T212**/**TR** (avoid card top-ups and their % fees). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007139838-What-are-the-fees-for-funding-my-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for funding my account?"))
    
3. **Place orders smartly:**
    
    - **US €500** → **T212** (~€0.75 FX). **US €1,000** → **TR** (€1). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))
        
    - **ETF** → pick **UCITS EUR-listed** (e.g., **SXR8**) on **T212** (commission **€0**). ([Börse Frankfurt](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/etf/ishares-core-s-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-acc?utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (Acc)"))
        
    - **Gold** → **JE00B588CD74** (EUR line) on **T212** (commission **€0**) or **TR** (€1). ([Börse Frankfurt](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/etf/wisdomtree-physical-swiss-gold-etc?utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold ETC ETC | A1DCTK"))
        
    - **Crypto** → **TR** (€1/trade). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))
        
4. **Cash you won’t invest immediately:** keep in **Revolut DGS-insured deposits** for max protection; or use **T212 interest on cash** if you accept MMF risk for a bit more yield. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))

If you want, tell me roughly how you’ll split the **€300** and that **$756** (e.g., “€200 ETF / €100 US stock; move all $756 to EUR savings”), and I’ll compute the **exact € fees** you’d pay with this plan and the **net yield** on the parked cash.

---

Got it — you want something that’s safe long-term, simple to run for 10+ years, and as close to fee-free as possible. Given you’re already in Revolut and you prefer Trade Republic (TR) over T212, here’s a clean, low-friction plan that keeps Revolut as your “cash hub” and uses TR for investing.

# Safety snapshot (so you can sleep well)

- **Revolut Instant Access Savings (EUR):** bank **deposits** with Revolut Bank UAB are covered by the **EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) up to €100,000** per person. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-LT/help/app-features/savings-vaults/getting-started-with-instant-access-savings/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Getting started with Instant Access Savings"))
    
- **Revolut “Flexible Cash Funds” (USD 2.98% you mentioned):** these are **money market funds**, not bank deposits. Assets fall under **Lithuanian Liabilities to Investors insurance up to €22,000** (firm failure to return assets), and they carry **market/FX risk**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/wealth/stocks/more-help-with-stocks/investment-protection/how-are-my-investments-with-revolut-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are my investments with Revolut protected?"))
    
- **Trade Republic cash:** uninvested cash is held at **partner banks** (Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, HSBC, etc.) and covered by **DGS up to €100,000 per partner bank**; TR also pays **interest on cash (around 2% p.a., caps depend on country/IBAN setup)**. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-sk/743-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
    
- **Your securities (stocks/ETFs/gold ETCs) at TR:** held segregated; if a firm can’t return assets, EU **investor-compensation** schemes generally cover **90% up to €20,000** (this is about the broker’s failure, not market losses). ([BaFin](https://www.bafin.de/EN/Verbraucher/Bank/Einlagensicherung/einlagensicherung_node_en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit guarantee and investor compensation schemes"))
    
- **Crypto (any platform):** **not** protected by deposit/investor schemes; be okay with full-loss risk. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/understanding-revolut-cryptocurrency/crypto-safety/who-provides-revolut-s-crypto-services/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Who provides Revolut's crypto services?"))
    

# How to move money with **zero or near-zero fees**

- **From Revolut → TR:** use a **SEPA bank transfer**, not card top-up (the €3 you saw is a card fee). Revolut says **EUR SEPA transfers are free**, and TR explicitly supports **SEPA deposits**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/transfers/outbound-transfers/how-to-send-money-to-another-bank/how-do-i-send-money-to-a-bank-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to transfer funds from Revolut"))
    
- **USD→EUR conversion in Revolut:** convert **on weekdays** to avoid the **1% weekend FX markup** on Standard plans. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
- **Back from TR → your bank:** bank withdrawals are supported (allow up to a few banking days). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/nl-nl/753-How-can-I-withdraw-money?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I withdraw money?"))
    

# Fee-minimised execution plan (today forward)

### 1) Keep Revolut as your cash hub

- **Emergency/near-term EUR** → keep in **Revolut Instant Access Savings** (DGS-insured). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-FR/help/app-features/savings-vaults/understanding-savings-vaults-products/how-are-the-funds-in-my-savings-vaults-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are the funds in my Instant Access Savings protected?"))
    
- **Your current $756 at 2.98% (Flexible Cash Funds):**
    
    - If you value **simplicity**, you can keep it there, understanding it’s an **investment product (MMF)** with **€22k investor insurance** and **USD FX risk**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/wealth/stocks/more-help-with-stocks/investment-protection/how-are-my-investments-with-revolut-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are my investments with Revolut protected?"))
        
    - If you want everything consolidated at TR while still earning, **convert USD→EUR on a weekday**, **SEPA to TR**, and let it earn TR’s **cash interest (c. 2% p.a., DGS-backed)** until invested. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
        

### 2) Fund Trade Republic the cheap way

- In TR app: **Wealth/Cash → Transfer → Add money → Bank transfer** to see your IBAN; then **SEPA from Revolut**. (Avoid card top-ups.) ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-lu/2678-How-do-I-transfer-money-to-my-Trade-Republic-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I transfer money to my Trade Republic account?"))
    

### 3) Invest your **€300** now with **€0 buy fees** using TR **Savings Plans**

Savings plans at TR **execute without a buy fee**; you only pay **€1 when you sell** later. This is perfect for your 10-year DCA approach. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))  
Create three savings plans (they can start at the next execution date):

- **US equity core (ETF): €200/mo** → e.g., a UCITS S&P 500 accumulator such as **iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS (IE00B5BMR087 — CSPX/SXR8)**. (EU retail can’t buy US-domiciled ETFs due to **PRIIPs/KID** rules; use **UCITS** equivalents.) ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/us-domiciled-etfs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "US-domiciled ETFs: why they are no longer available from ..."))
    
- **Gold (ETC): €50/mo** → a **physically-backed** EU ETC like **iShares Physical Gold (IE00B4ND3602)** or **WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold (JE00B588CD74)**. ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4ND3602&utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Physical Gold ETC | A1KWPQ | IE00B4ND3602"))
    
- **Crypto (BTC/ETH): €50/mo** → TR **crypto savings plans** are supported and **minimum is €1** per run; buys via savings plans are fee-free (manual crypto trades are **€1** flat). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/1499-Can-I-set-up-a-savings-plan-for-crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Can I set up a savings plan for crypto?"))
    

> Why savings plans? They avoid the per-trade €1 on small buys; you’ll only face €1 **when you eventually sell** each asset. For your €300–€1,000 tickets, that’s very efficient. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))

### 4) Deploy the **$756** next

Pick one of these and execute:

- **Keep in Revolut Flexible (stay in USD)** for now if you like the yield and don’t mind FX risk. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/wealth/stocks/more-help-with-stocks/investment-protection/how-are-my-investments-with-revolut-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are my investments with Revolut protected?"))
    
- **Or** convert USD→EUR mid-week and **SEPA to TR**. You can either (a) let it earn TR cash interest while staged, or (b) top up the same three savings plans above (you can add a **one-off “extra” to the next SP run**, or temporarily raise the SP amounts). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    

### 5) Ongoing habits (set-and-forget)

- **Automate funding**: enable **TR direct debit** to pull the monthly total from your reference account so savings plans always run. (Free.) ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-be/843-How-do-I-set-up-direct-debit-payments-for-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I set up direct debit payments for savings plans?"))
    
- **Rebalance**: once a year, nudge the plan back to your target mix (each **sell** costs **€1**). ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    
- **Keep buys mid-week** if you ever do manual FX in Revolut (avoids weekend markup). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    

# Why not just stay inside Revolut for everything?

- **Crypto fees** on a Standard plan are typically **tiered, starting ~1.49%** of trade value; TR is **€1 flat** (and **€0** on savings-plan buys), which is usually cheaper for your ticket sizes. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-CY/crypto/tiered-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Tiered Pricing"))
    
- **UCITS ETFs** (what you need as an EU retail investor) are fully supported at TR; you **can’t buy US-domiciled ETFs** in the EU retail channel due to **PRIIPs/KID**. ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/us-domiciled-etfs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "US-domiciled ETFs: why they are no longer available from ..."))
    
- **Cash protection** at TR is classic **€100k DGS via partner banks**; Revolut’s **Flexible Cash Funds** are **not** deposit-insured (they’re MMFs with €22k investor-insurance). You may prefer DGS for your euro cash buffer. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-sk/743-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))
    

# If you ever need to switch later

- **Cash**: SEPA transfers **free** in the SEPA area. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/transfers/outbound-transfers/how-to-send-money-to-another-bank/how-do-i-send-money-to-a-bank-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to transfer funds from Revolut"))
    
- **Assets**: Selling in TR is **€1 per asset**; no custody/inactivity fees. (Mind taxes, of course.) ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))

## TL;DR – your next moves

1. **Leave EUR emergency cash** in **Revolut Instant Access Savings** (DGS). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-FR/help/app-features/savings-vaults/understanding-savings-vaults-products/how-are-the-funds-in-my-savings-vaults-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are the funds in my Instant Access Savings protected?"))
    
2. **SEPA €300** from Revolut to TR (no fee). **Set 3 TR savings plans**: S&P 500 UCITS **€200**, physical gold **€50**, crypto **€50** — fee-free buys, €1 only when selling. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/transfers/outbound-transfers/how-to-send-money-to-another-bank/how-do-i-send-money-to-a-bank-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to transfer funds from Revolut"))
    
3. For the **$756**: either **keep** in Revolut Flexible (know it’s an MMF with €22k investor insurance + USD risk), **or** convert on a weekday and **SEPA to TR** to earn DGS-backed TR cash interest until invested. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/wealth/stocks/more-help-with-stocks/investment-protection/how-are-my-investments-with-revolut-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are my investments with Revolut protected?"))
    

If you want, tell me your exact ETF/crypto preferences (e.g., S&P 500 vs. S&P 500+Nasdaq split, BTC vs. ETH), and I’ll plug in specific UCITS tickers you can add to the savings plans.
