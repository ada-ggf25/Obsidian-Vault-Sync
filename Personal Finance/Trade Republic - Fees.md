Short answer: you don’t need to switch to T212 just to avoid the €1 fee—**use Trade Republic savings plans** and the buy fee becomes **€0** even for multiple positions. Then add T212 only when it’s _actually_ cheaper.

## What’s cheapest in your case

- **UCITS S&P 500 ETF** → **TR savings plan** = **€0** per buy.
    
- **Your US stocks (AAPL, NVDA, META, PLTR, TSMC)** →
    
    - If available as **TR savings plans** (most big caps are): **€0** per buy (min ~€10/plan).
        
    - If you place **ad-hoc** orders: **TR €1** vs **T212 0.15% FX**. Break-even ≈ **€667** (below that, T212’s % is <€1; above that, TR wins).
        
- **Crypto (80% BTC / 20% ETH)** → **TR savings plan** = **€0** per buy (manual crypto trades are €1).
    

So for a small, diversified monthly DCA (e.g., €300 across ETF + 5 stocks + BTC/ETH), **TR can be €0 in buy fees** if you set them all as savings plans.

## When T212 makes sense

- You want a **one-off small USD stock** buy (<~€667) **outside** a plan → T212’s **0.15% FX** can be cheaper than TR’s €1.
    
- You want **multi-currency cash** inside the broker (hold USD/GBP balances) or prefer its **AutoInvest Pies**.
    

## A simple, fee-lite setup (example)

- TR savings plans:
    
    - **€200** → **CSPX/SXR8** (S&P 500, Acc)
        
    - **€12** each → **AAPL, NVDA, META, PLTR, TSMC** (total **€60**)
        
    - **€40** crypto → **€32 BTC / €8 ETH**
        
- All **€0** buy fees; you’ll only pay **€1 when you ever sell** each position, years from now.
    

**Bottom line:** For your “few money + diversify” goal, **Trade Republic with savings plans** is already the smart, near-free route. Keep **T212** as a tactical tool for the occasional small, ad-hoc USD stock order or if a specific stock isn’t eligible for a TR plan.

Totally—here’s exactly how to get **€0 buy fees** on Trade Republic using **Savings Plans** (stocks, ETFs and even crypto).

# Step-by-step: make buys cost **€0**

1. **Fund TR the free way (SEPA)**
    
    - In the TR app: **Cash → Add money → Bank transfer** to see your **personal IBAN**.
        
    - From Revolut/Santander send a **SEPA EUR transfer** to that IBAN. Bank transfers are **free**; avoid card top-ups (after the first one they cost **0.7%**). ([BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/trade-republic-review/trade-republic-fees?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic Fees Explained"))
        
2. **Create a Savings Plan (ETF / stock / crypto)**
    
    - App path: **Wealth (or Cash) → Browse → search your asset → Save**.
        
    - Enter the **amount** you want to invest regularly → **Next**.
        
    - Pick the **frequency**: weekly / twice-monthly / monthly / quarterly.
        
    - Choose the **date** (start/mid-month).
        
    - Pick **payment method** (use your TR cash balance, or set up SEPA direct debit if available).
        
    - **Confirm**. You can edit/cancel anytime for free. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/pl-pl/768-How-can-I-create-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I create a savings plan?"))
        
3. **Why this is free**
    
    - **Savings plan executions have no order fee**. TR explicitly states: **“There are no fees for the execution of savings plans.”** You only pay **€1** when you **sell** (and €1 on any **manual** one-off trade outside a plan). ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/760-What-are-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are savings plans?"))
        
4. **Minimum amounts**
    
    - You can “invest from **€1**” on TR; **crypto savings plans** have a **€1** minimum. (For some assets the app may show a slightly higher minimum—follow what it shows.) ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-ie?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
        
5. **Execution timing**
    
    - Your plan is **executed on the day you set**; the price is the market price at execution. (TR doesn’t charge a fee on plan buys; normal market spread still applies.)

## Example setups (all **€0** to buy)

- **S&P 500 (accumulating)**: search **IE00B5BMR087** (iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS; pick the **EUR** line like **SXR8**), create a **monthly** plan (e.g., **€200**). ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/pl-pl/768-How-can-I-create-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I create a savings plan?"))
    
- **Your 5 stocks** (AAPL/NVDA/META/PLTR/TSMC): make **five small plans** (e.g., **€10–€15** each monthly). Plans on stocks are also fee-free to buy. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/760-What-are-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are savings plans?"))
    
- **Crypto 80/20**: make two plans, e.g., **€32 BTC** and **€8 ETH** monthly; **crypto plan buys are fee-free** (manual crypto trades cost €1). ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/sv-se/1499-Can-I-set-up-a-savings-plan-for-crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Can I set up a savings plan for crypto?"))
    

> You’ll only pay **€1** **when you sell** each asset years from now, or if you place a **manual** one-off order instead of a plan. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/760-What-are-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are savings plans?"))

## Pro tips

- **Keep enough EUR in TR** a day before your plan date so executions don’t fail. (Use **SEPA** from Revolut; avoid card top-ups/fees.) ([BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/trade-republic-review/trade-republic-fees?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic Fees Explained"))
    
- If you **want exact intraday timing**, place a **manual** buy during market hours (costs **€1**); otherwise let the plan run for free. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-be/support?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic help center"))
    
- For **S&P 500**, prefer **accumulating UCITS** (e.g., CSPX/SXR8) and the **EUR trading line** to avoid extra FX on execution. (You still get USD exposure via the underlying.)
    

If you want, tell me the **exact monthly amounts** you want in ETF / each stock / BTC / ETH and I’ll draft the **precise plan list** you can tap in (ISINs + cadence + dates) so everything runs at **€0** buy fees.
