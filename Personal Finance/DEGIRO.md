Awesome—now that I know your goals (EU resident, long-term buy-and-hold in UCITS ETFs, US stocks, gold and a bit of crypto, plus a safe place to park cash), here’s a straight-to-the-point comparison of **Trade Republic (TR)** vs **Trading 212 (T212)** vs **DEGIRO** and what I’d pick for you.

# Quick verdict (for your use case)

- **Primary broker: Trade Republic.** Free automated savings plans for **ETFs, stocks _and crypto_**, simple €1 per manual trade, 2% interest on idle EUR with **€100k deposit protection**, and SEPA deposits free (so no top-up fees if you use a bank transfer). ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/760-What-are-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are savings plans?"))
    
- **Runner-up: Trading 212** if you care about **multi-currency cash** and a slightly higher EUR/USD cash yield and don’t need spot crypto. You get **interest on EUR and USD** (e.g., EUR 2.2% AER; USD 4.1% AER at the time of writing), true **multi-currency** balances and **0.15% FX** when converting. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- **DEGIRO** is great for market access and a low fee on some ETFs, but it’s weaker for your plan: **no spot crypto, no interest on cash,** auto-FX is **0.25%**, and there are **per-exchange connectivity fees**.

## Nuances that matter for you

- **Crypto custody & withdrawals:** TR sells _real_ crypto but **doesn’t let you withdraw to your own wallet** (you must sell to cash first). If self-custody matters to you, use a dedicated exchange/wallet for that slice. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1497-Is-it-possible-to-receive-and-send-Crypto-with-other-wallets?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Is it possible to receive and send crypto with other wallets?"))
    
- **FX & listings:** TR is **EUR-only** and often routes via EU venues (e.g., LS Exchange). You’ll usually find the big US names, but **not every US ticker** is available exactly as on NYSE/Nasdaq, and spreads can be wider off-venue. T212 gives **direct USD listings + multi-currency** if you want to hold USD. ([Investing in the Web](https://investingintheweb.com/reviews/trade-republic-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic review (2025) | Our in-depth analysis"))
    
- **Idle cash yield & protection:**
    
    - TR: **2%** and **bank-deposit protection (€100k)**. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-nl/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
        
    - T212: **higher posted EUR/USD rates** but cash may be split between **banks and QMMFs** (the **MMF portion is not deposit-guaranteed**—still very conservative, but different risk). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
        
    - DEGIRO: **0%** on cash; don’t park idle money there. ([Degiro.com](https://www.degiro.com/uk/helpdesk/money-transfers-and-handling/does-degiro-pay-interest-uninvested-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Does DEGIRO Pay Interest on Uninvested Cash?"))
        
- **Funding fees:** You mentioned seeing **€3 on a €300 TR deposit**—that’s typical of _card_ top-ups. Use **SEPA bank transfer** to TR to avoid funding fees entirely. (Same advice on T212 once you pass €2k in lifetime card deposits.) ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-lu/2678-How-do-I-transfer-money-to-my-Trade-Republic-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I transfer money to my Trade Republic account?"))

## My recommendation for your setup

Given your long horizon, DCA style, and desire to keep fees ultra-low:

1. **Do your investing on Trade Republic.**
    
    - Set up **fee-free savings plans** for your UCITS ETF(s) and any US stocks you’re building, plus any **crypto DCA** you want. Manual one-offs are €1 when needed. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/760-What-are-savings-plans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are savings plans?"))
        
    - Hold your EUR cash buffer there at **2%** with **€100k DGS**. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-nl/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
        
2. **Optionally add Trading 212 just for cash in USD (or extra EUR yield)** if you want to **hold USD alongside EUR** and earn interest on both, and you don’t need spot crypto in that account. Remember the **0.15% FX** on conversions and to use **bank transfer** funding. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/multi-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multi-currency account for investors"))
    
3. **Skip DEGIRO** for this plan unless you specifically need an ETF/stock only they list or want a **Core Selection ETF** (one free buy per month + €1 handling). No cash interest and higher FX make it less ideal for your style. ([Degiro.com](https://www.degiro.com/uk/fees "Low fees stock trading | Broker DEGIRO"))
    

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny action checklist (which ETFs to put on TR savings plans, how to split the €300 across ETF/gold/crypto, and where to keep your USD/EUR cash).
