Super helpful context — thanks. Given you’re on **free plans**, hold **USD at Revolut (≈2.98% APY)** right now, and saw a **€3 fee on a €300** top-up to TR, here’s the clean, **low-cost** way to set things up for **buy & hold** with €500–€1,000+ tickets.

# Key facts (so fees don’t bite)

- **Revolut Flexible Cash Funds (USD)**: APY is around **3.01% (Standard)** as of **16 Mar 2025**. It’s **a money-market fund (investment)**, **not a deposit**; **no deposit guarantee**. Covered instead by the **Lithuanian Liabilities to Investors Scheme up to €22k**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-FR/help/app-features/flexible-accounts/where-can-i-find-current-in-flexibleaccountsname-flexible-account-in-flexibleaccountsname/ "Where can I find current Flexible Cash Funds interest rates? | Revolut France"))
    
- **Revolut FX**: On **weekends** they add **~1%** on currency exchanges (Standard plan). Do weekday FX to avoid it. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
- **Trade Republic (TR) funding**: **SEPA EUR bank transfers are free**; card/Apple-Pay/Google-Pay deposits typically incur a **~0.7%** fee after the first one — that’s why your €300 showed ~€3. So: **use SEPA, not card**. TR **only accepts incoming EUR from SEPA**. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/3249-What-do-I-need-to-know-about-the-Trade-Republic-current-account- "What do I need to know about the Trade Republic current account?"))
    
- **Trading 212 (T212) funding**: **Bank transfer free**. Card/Apple/Google Pay are **free only up to €2,000 cumulative**, then **0.7%**. Again: **use SEPA**. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- **Cash yields** (idle money): **T212 ~2.20% AER (EUR)**, paid daily; **TR ~2.00% p.a.** (they pass on ECB deposit facility); Revolut USD flexible rate ~3% APY (investment, not deposit). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    

# Cheapest routing for your tickets (€500–€1,000+)

**ETFs (UCITS) & EUR-listed stocks → _Trading 212_**

- **€0 commission**; only **0.15% FX** if the instrument is **not** in EUR. Pick **EUR-listed UCITS ETFs** to avoid FX entirely. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/11471996799517-What-are-the-fees-in-the-Invest-and-ISAs?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees in the Invest and ISAs?"))
    

**US-listed single stocks → _T212_ or _Trade Republic_ (by size)**

- **T212** charges **0.15% FX**. **TR** charges **€1/order**.
    
- Break-even: **€1 ÷ 0.0015 ≈ €667**.
    
    - **< €667** ⇒ **T212** cheaper (e.g., €500 → €0.75 vs €1).
        
    - **≥ €667** ⇒ **TR** cheaper (e.g., €1,000 → €1 vs €1.50). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
        

**Gold (long-term exposure) → _Either T212 or TR_**

- Buy a **large, physically-backed gold ETC/ETF** that trades in **EUR**.
    
- **T212:** €0 commission (and €0 FX if EUR-listed).
    
- **TR:** **€1** per order; savings plans **€0 to buy**.
    
- **Avoid Revolut commodities** on Standard: **0.99% per buy/sell (min €1)**. On €1,000 that’s **€9.90** each side. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))
    

**Crypto (buy & hold) → _Trade Republic_**

- **TR:** **€1/trade** (very cheap for €500–€1,000 tickets) — but **no on-chain deposits/withdrawals**.
    
- **Revolut:** **tiered % fee** (Standard often **~1.49%** up to 10k/30d) with **minimums**; supports **some withdrawals**. For cost alone, **TR wins** at your sizes; for **self-custody**, use **Revolut** (or a dedicated exchange). ([Datawallet](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/buy-crypto-with-trade-republic?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Buy Crypto with Trade Republic - Datawallet"))
    

**Idle cash (APY/AER)**

- Park uninvested **EUR** where it pays **most with low friction**: **T212 ~2.20% AER** (daily) slightly beats **TR ~2.00%**. Your **USD** at Revolut ~**3% APY** is higher but brings **EUR⇄USD FX risk** and isn’t a deposit. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    

# Move-money playbook (minimise fees today)

1. **Convert USD→EUR in Revolut on a weekday** (avoid the 1% weekend markup). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
2. **Fund brokers via SEPA EUR** from Revolut:
    
    - Add **T212/Trade Republic IBANs** as beneficiaries; include any **reference code** TR shows. **Do not use card top-ups** to avoid the 0.7–1% hit. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
        
3. **Allocate by the rules above** (T212 for EUR ETFs & sub-€667 US orders; TR for larger US tickets, savings plans, and crypto).

### Quick fee examples at your sizes

- **US stock €500:** T212 **€0.75** (0.15% FX) vs TR **€1** → **T212 wins**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
    
- **US stock €1,000:** T212 **€1.50** vs TR **€1** → **TR wins**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
    
- **Gold €1,000 (EUR-listed ETC):** T212 **€0** vs TR **€1** vs Revolut **€9.90** → **T212/TR ≫ Revolut**. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))
    
- **Crypto €1,000:** TR **€1** vs Revolut **~€14.90** (Standard 1.49%) → **TR ≫ Revolut** (unless you need withdrawals). ([Datawallet](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/buy-crypto-with-trade-republic?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Buy Crypto with Trade Republic - Datawallet"))

If you want, tell me roughly how much you’ll DCA per month into **ETFs**, **US stocks**, **gold**, and **crypto** (e.g., “€600 ETF, €1,000 US stock quarterly, €1,000 gold once a year, €200/mo crypto”), and I’ll map the **exact € fees** you’ll pay under **T212 vs TR vs Revolut** for your pattern and point to the absolute cheapest mix.

Great — here’s the **clean, low-fee way** to move those two pots from Revolut and place the buys you want.

# 1) First deposits: how to fund T212 / TR without fees

- **Always use bank transfer (SEPA)** from Revolut. **Card top-ups cost ~0.7%** (T212 after your first €2,000 lifetime card deposits; TR card top-ups can also incur a fee). **SEPA bank transfers are free.** ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007139838-What-are-the-fees-for-funding-my-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for funding my account?"))
    
- **TR only accepts EUR via SEPA** (no USD wires). In the app: Wealth/Cash → Transfer → _Add money_ → _Bank transfer_ to see your **TR IBAN** and reference. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/3249-What-do-I-need-to-know-about-the-Trade-Republic-current-account-?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What do I need to know about the Trade Republic current ..."))
    
- **T212**: bank transfer is free; card/Apple/Google Pay **free only up to €2,000 cumulative**, then **0.7%**. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    

---

# 2) The €300 you want to invest **now** (US **stocks & ETFs** only)

For US-priced orders, compare:

- **Trading 212 (T212)**: **0.15% FX** on each buy/sell; no commission.
    
- **Trade Republic (TR)**: **€1 per order**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA) - Trading 212"))
    

**Break-even:** €1 ÷ 0.0015 ≈ **€667**.

- For **€300 orders**, **T212 is cheaper** (**~€0.45** FX vs **€1** at TR).
    
- For **€1,000 orders**, **TR is cheaper** (**€1** vs **€1.50** on T212).
    

### What I’d do with €300 (today)

- **US stocks/ETFs → T212** (keeps fees tiny at your ticket size).
    
- **Gold**: you **can’t buy US-domiciled ETFs** as an EEA retail investor (PRIIPs/KID rules). Use a **UCITS gold ETC/ETF** listed in the EU (pick a **EUR-traded** line on T212 to avoid FX). ([European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2021-004745_EN.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Restricted access to US ETFs for ordinary EU retail investors"))
    
- **Crypto**: T212 has **no spot crypto**; **TR** is **€1 per trade** (but **no on-chain withdrawals** — fine for buy-and-hold, not for self-custody). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/11471996799517-What-are-the-fees-in-the-Invest-and-ISAs?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees in the Invest and ISAs? - Trading 212"))
    

If you want to split €300 across all four buckets **today**, the least-fee split is:

- Stocks/ETFs on **T212**;
    
- Crypto on **TR**;
    
- Gold via a **EUR-listed UCITS ETC** on **T212**.
    

(FYI: If you’d rather keep per-order costs near zero, you can also **rotate**: month 1 stocks/ETFs on T212, month 2 crypto on TR, etc.)

# 3) The **$756** you hold at **2.98% APY** in Revolut (USD)

You have two clean paths:

### Path A (simplest / free transfer)

1. **Weekday** in Revolut: **convert USD→EUR** (avoid the **1% weekend FX fee** on Standard). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
2. **SEPA transfer EUR** to **T212** (or **TR**) for free. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
3. If buying US stocks on **T212**, it will convert EUR→USD at **0.15%** when you place the order. For ~$756 (≈€700), that’s **~€1**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA) - Trading 212"))
    

### Path B (to keep it in **USD** earning interest)

- **T212 lets you hold USD cash** and currently shows **~4.1% AER USD**, **paid daily**. You can **deposit in USD** and/or convert inside T212 (0.15% FX). Over a year, moving from ~2.98% (Revolut) to ~4.1% (T212) adds **~1.1%/yr**; on $756 that’s **≈$8.40/yr**, which **easily offsets** the ~€1 conversion cost if you deposit EUR and switch to USD inside T212. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- **Warning on wires:** sending **USD** from Revolut to T212 by **SWIFT** can incur intermediary bank fees. That’s why most people **convert to EUR in Revolut** and **SEPA it**. (T212 supports multi-currency deposits, but SWIFT fees depend on the sending bank.) ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/11669719976093-What-is-a-multi-currency-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is a multi-currency account?"))
    

---

# 4) Where to **park idle cash** going forward

- **T212 EUR cash**: ~**2.20% AER**, **paid daily** (via QMMFs/time deposits), toggled in-app. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- **TR EUR cash**: **2.0% p.a.**, accrued daily, **paid monthly**. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    
- **Revolut “Flexible Cash Funds” (USD/EUR/GBP)**: these are **money-market funds (investments), not deposits**; in the EEA coverage is via **Lithuania’s investor scheme up to €22k**, not a deposit guarantee. APY varies; check in-app. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-CY/help/app-features/flexible-accounts/getting-started-with-in-flexibleaccountsname-flexible-accounts-in-flexibleaccountsname-in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Getting started with Flexible Cash Funds"))

## Step-by-step you can do right now

1. **€300 → T212/TR (free)**  
    Revolut → _Payments_ → _Bank transfer_ → add your **T212** (or **TR**) **EUR IBAN** → send **€300 (SEPA)**. (Don’t use card top-up.) ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
2. **Buy**
    
    - US stocks/ETFs on **T212** (0.15% FX). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA) - Trading 212"))
        
    - **Gold** via **UCITS** EUR-listed ETC on **T212** (no FX).
        
    - **Crypto** on **TR** (each buy **€1**; remember no wallet withdrawals). ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-gr/449-Can-I-cash-out-my-crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Can I cash out my crypto?"))
        
3. **$756 USD**
    
    - Easiest: **Weekday** USD→EUR in Revolut (avoid weekend fee) → **SEPA** to **T212** → buy US stocks (0.15% FX on order). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
        
    - Or, if you want **higher USD yield** and to keep it in dollars: **SEPA EUR to T212**, then **convert to USD inside T212 (0.15%)** and enable **interest on USD cash** (~4.1% AER). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))

### Quick fee math at your sizes (handy)

- **US €500 order:** T212 **€0.75** vs TR **€1** → **T212 wins**.
    
- **US €1,000 order:** T212 **€1.50** vs TR **€1** → **TR wins**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA) - Trading 212"))
    
- **Crypto €1,000:** TR **€1** vs Revolut Standard **~€14.90 (1.49%)**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/business/help/receiving-payments/currency-exchanges/exchanging-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Exchanging currencies | Revolut United States"))
    

If you tell me how you want to split the **€300** (e.g., **€200 ETF / €50 stock / €50 crypto**) and what you plan to do with the **$756**, I’ll compute the **exact euro fees** for each route (T212 vs TR vs Revolut) and suggest the cheapest clicks.
