Gotcha—by “ARY” you mean **APY/AER** (effective annual yield). If your goal is to **park EUR cash** with a solid yield and **instant access**, here’s the snapshot for Portugal right now:

### Best simple options (EUR)

- **Trade Republic – Cash interest**: **~2.00% p.a.** on idle cash, paid monthly; cash is held at partner banks and **deposit-insured up to €100k per bank**. No lock-in. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    
- **Revolut – Instant Access Savings (deposit)**: **~1.0%–2.25% AER (variable)** depending on plan; deposits **insured up to €100k** with Revolut Bank UAB. Rates move with ECB cuts, so check your in-app rate. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-FR/help/app-features/savings-vaults/more-help-with-savings/rate-decrease-on-my-savings/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest rate decrease for Instant Access Savings"))
    
- **Portuguese term deposits (time deposits)**: Top offers around **~3.0% gross** (but usually require locking for a fixed term and can auto-renew at lower rates). ([thebanks.eu](https://thebanks.eu/compare-banking-products/time-deposit-accounts/Portugal?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Compare Time Deposit Accounts in Portugal"))
    
- **Money-market ETFs/funds (via broker)**: Very low-risk bond/cash instruments; yield tracks short-term EUR rates (not deposit-insured). Examples include newly launched **iShares € Cash UCITS ETF** and **EUR ultrashort bond ETFs**. ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/fb7034dd-005e-451e-bc5a-c64b618686e8?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BlackRock launches active short-term money market ETF"))
    

### Tax angle (Portugal)

Bank deposit interest is taxed at **28%** (withholding). Quick net examples on **€10,000** for one year:

- **2.00%** → **€144 net** (2.00% × (1–0.28))
    
- **2.25%** → **€162 net**
    
- **3.00%** (time deposit) → **€216 net**  
    (You can opt to aggregate in IRS if that’s better for you.) ([clientebancario.bportugal.pt](https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/interest-rates?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest rates | Portal do Cliente Bancario - Banco de Portugal"))
    

### My take (simple rules)

- Want **max simplicity + decent rate** with instant access? **Trade Republic cash (2% p.a.)** is hard to beat right now. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    
- Already pay for a **Revolut plan** and prefer everything in one app? Use **Revolut Instant Access Savings**—just confirm your **current AER** in-app. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-IE/instant-access-savings/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Turn Idle Cash Into Interest | Start Saving Online | Revolut Ireland"))
    
- Can **lock money** for a few months? A **time deposit** at ~3% gross usually wins **after tax** vs most instant-access fintech rates. ([thebanks.eu](https://thebanks.eu/compare-banking-products/time-deposit-accounts/Portugal?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Compare Time Deposit Accounts in Portugal"))
    
- Comfortable with a fund (not insured)? A **EUR money-market ETF** can be competitive and is sellable any day via your broker. ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/fb7034dd-005e-451e-bc5a-c64b618686e8?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BlackRock launches active short-term money market ETF"))
    

If you tell me roughly **how much** and **whether you need instant access**, I’ll run the exact net-of-tax euros for your case.

Great question—the “right” move depends on whether you want **maximum safety (deposit insurance in EUR)** or you’re okay with a **money-market fund (MMF) in USD** for a bit more yield.

## What’s the safest “account that returns X%” for you

- **Safest (deposit-insured):**
    
    - **Revolut Instant Access Savings (EUR)** — deposits with **Revolut Bank UAB** are DGS-insured up to **€100,000**. Rate varies by plan/currency (check in-app). ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/blog/post/how-we-keep-your-money-safe-if-youre-a-customer-in-the-european-economic-area/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How we keep your money safe if you're a customer in ..."))
        
    - **Trade Republic cash interest (EUR)** — uninvested cash is held at **partner banks** (e.g., Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan SE) with **€100,000** deposit protection; they currently **pass on ~2% p.a.** interest, accrued daily, paid monthly. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-es?=null&openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic. Invest, spend and bank."))
        
- **Not a deposit (still low risk, but different protection):**
    
    - **Revolut Flexible Cash Funds (your ~2.98% in USD)** — that’s **MMFs** via Revolut Securities Europe UAB; covered by **Lithuania’s investor scheme up to €22,000** if the firm fails to safeguard assets; **no deposit guarantee**, and you carry **USD/EUR FX risk**. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/flexible-cash-funds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Maximise your Funds | Grow your Money Online"))
        

## So… should you move the USD money from Revolut to TR?

Use this simple rule:

- **If you prioritise safety + EUR base and/or you’ll invest from TR soon → _Yes, move_.**  
    Convert **USD→EUR on a weekday** (Standard plan has weekend FX markup), then **SEPA** the EUR to TR. You’ll be deposit-insured on cash and earn ~**2% p.a.** at TR while you wait to invest. ([The Scottish Sun](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/money/14377489/revolut-exchange-currency-change-fees-holidays-travel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Popular bank is making a change to fees in time for summer and holidaymakers will be delighted"))
    
- **If you prioritise yield and don’t mind MMF (no DGS) + USD exposure → _No, keep it_ in Revolut Flexible for now.**  
    Just remember your protection is **€22k investor insurance** (not DGS), and your balance will move with USD vs EUR. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/flexible-cash-funds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Maximise your Funds | Grow your Money Online"))
    

## Where to keep ongoing “cash-park” money

- **DGS-insured EUR parking (max safety):** Revolut **Instant Access Savings** **or** TR **cash interest**. Pick the better rate you see today; both are **€100k-insured**. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/blog/post/how-we-keep-your-money-safe-if-youre-a-customer-in-the-european-economic-area/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How we keep your money safe if you're a customer in ..."))
    
- **If you want higher USD yield and multi-currency later:** Trading 212 pays interest on cash in multiple currencies but may place funds in **QMMFs** (not deposit-insured) unless held at banks; rates are shown in-app. This is optional since you prefer TR. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/15475153380637-What-is-interest-on-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is interest on cash?"))
    

## Practical next steps (low-friction)

1. **Decide safety vs yield** using the rule above.
    
2. If moving: **USD→EUR in Revolut on a weekday**, then **SEPA** to TR (avoid card top-ups/fees). ([The Scottish Sun](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/money/14377489/revolut-exchange-currency-change-fees-holidays-travel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Popular bank is making a change to fees in time for summer and holidaymakers will be delighted"))
    
3. On TR, let idle cash earn interest (deposit-insured) until your **ETF/stock/gold/crypto** savings plans execute. Crypto/single trades are **€1**, savings-plan buys are **€0**. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    

### My recommendation for you

Given your 10-year plan and preference for TR: **move the USD to EUR and park it either in Revolut Instant Access (EUR) or directly at TR**, depending on where you’ll deploy first. That keeps you **deposit-insured**, avoids USD FX risk, and keeps fees near zero (weekday FX + SEPA). Keep Santander as your separate emergency buffer.

If you want, tell me roughly how much “parked cash” you’ll keep vs how much you’ll DCA each month, and I’ll suggest the exact split (e.g., “€X in Revolut Instant Access, €Y idle at TR, €Z into TR savings plans”) with the protections and current mechanics for each.
