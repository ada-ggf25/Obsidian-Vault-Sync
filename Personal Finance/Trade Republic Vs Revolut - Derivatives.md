Short answer: for **stocks & ETFs** I’d pick **Trade Republic**; for **gold** I’d also use **Trade Republic** (via a physically-backed gold ETC). **Revolut** is fine if you want _everything in one app_ and you trade only occasionally, but its fees/FX markups make it pricier in practice.

# Quick comparison (Portugal)

|What you want|Trade Republic|Revolut|
|---|---|---|
|**Stocks & ETFs fees**|Flat **€1 per trade** (no custody fee). ETF savings plans often €0.|Plan-dependent: typically **€1 per trade** or a small monthly allowance of commission-free trades; “other fees may apply.” ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/about?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic. Invest, spend and bank."))|
|**FX on non-EUR assets**|Uses external reference rates; FX cost lives in the **spread** (no explicit extra fee published).|**Weekend mark-up** and fair-usage limits on exchanges; plan affects costs. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-nl/796-How-does-currency-conversion-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How does currency conversion work?"))|
|**Gold exposure**|Buy **gold ETC/ETFs** (e.g., WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold) for spot-tracking with low TER; normal €1 trade fee.|In-app **Commodities** = _exposure_ to precious metals (not deliverable to you); fee **0.99%** (Standard/Plus) or **0.49%** (Premium/Metal/Ultra) **per buy/sell** + spread. ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=JE00B588CD74&utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold \| A1DCTK"))|
|**Cash protection**|Cash up to **€100k** under deposit guarantee; securities segregated (German scheme applies for failures to return assets).|Investments under **€22k** Lithuanian investor protection (RSEUAB); securities segregated.

## Why I’d choose Trade Republic here

- **Total cost clarity:** €1 per stock/ETF trade is hard to beat for buy-and-hold. Revolut’s allowances and “other fees” (plus FX rules) make your effective cost less predictable. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/about?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic. Invest, spend and bank."))
    
- **Gold cheaper as a security:** A physically-backed **gold ETC** on Trade Republic (TER often ~0.15%) + €1 trade typically beats Revolut’s **0.49–0.99%** _each time you buy or sell_ (and in practice there’s also a spread). ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=JE00B588CD74&utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold | A1DCTK"))
    

## When Revolut can still make sense

- You already pay for **Premium/Metal/Ultra** and only place a **handful of trades** monthly inside your plan’s allowance.
    
- You want **one app** for banking + a small portfolio and don’t mind the commodity pricing/convenience trade-off.

### Practical picks for gold on Trade Republic

Look for large, physically-backed ETCs in EUR such as **WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold (JE00B588CD74)**; TER ~0.15% p.a. (check availability in your TR app). Buy/sell cost: **€1** per order. ([JustETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=JE00B588CD74&utm_source=chatgpt.com "WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold | A1DCTK"))

Here’s the head-to-head for **Portugal/EEA** across **stocks, ETFs, gold and crypto**.

# TL;DR

- **Stocks & ETFs → Trade Republic**: flat **€1/order** and **no custody fee**; usually cheaper and simpler for buy-and-hold. Revolut charges **0.25% per trade** once you exhaust the plan’s free-trade allowance **+ 0.12%/yr custody**, so costs creep up. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/809-What-is-the-ex_post-cost-information?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the ex-post cost information?"))
    
- **Gold → Trade Republic** (via a **physically-backed gold ETC**, e.g., WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold, **TER ~0.15%**): you pay **€1/trade** vs Revolut’s **0.99% (Std/Plus) or 0.49% (Prem/Metal/Ultra) per buy/sell** and it’s only “exposure”, not deliverable metal. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/809-What-is-the-ex_post-cost-information?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the ex-post cost information?"))
    
- **Crypto → Depends**:
    
    - Want **self-custody / on-chain withdrawals**? **Revolut** (supports some tokens/networks). **Trade Republic doesn’t allow any crypto transfers**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/transferring-cryptocurrencies/withdrawing-cryptocurrencies/how-do-i-send-crypto-to-an-external-wallet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Send (withdraw) crypto to an external address"))
        
    - Just **buy/hold**? **Trade Republic** is usually cheaper (**€1/order**) than Revolut’s tiered **~1.49%/0.99%/0.49%** (+ small-trade minimums).

### Cost break-evens (handy rules)

- **Stocks/ETFs:** Revolut’s 0.25% equals €1 at **€400**. So for small trades **under €400**, Revolut _outside_ allowance can be cheaper _per order_—but remember the **0.12%/yr custody**. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/stocks/trading-stocks/trading-fees/what-fees-will-i-be-charged-for-my-trading/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are Revolut's trading fees?"))
    
- **Crypto:** €1 at Trade Republic vs Revolut’s % fee breaks even at roughly: **€67 (1.49%)**, **€101 (0.99%)**, **€205 (0.49%)**, **€345 (0.29%)**. Above those sizes, €1/order is typically cheaper; below them, Revolut’s fee could be lower—subject to its **minimums**.

## My take

- For **stocks/ETFs** and **gold**: **Trade Republic** wins on transparent **€1/order** and **no custody fee**; use a **physically-backed gold ETC** if you want spot-like gold exposure with low ongoing cost. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-fi/809-What-is-the-ex_post-cost-information?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the ex-post cost information?"))
    
- For **crypto**:
    
    - If you need **withdrawals to your own wallet**, use **Revolut** (check supported tokens). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/transferring-cryptocurrencies/withdrawing-cryptocurrencies/how-do-i-send-crypto-to-an-external-wallet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Send (withdraw) crypto to an external address"))
        
    - If you’re **buy-and-hold** and order sizes are typically **>~€100–200**, **Trade Republic**’s flat **€1** is usually cheaper than Revolut’s % tiers. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))
        

If you tell me your **typical ticket size** and **how many trades/month** you do in each asset, I’ll run the exact euros you’d pay on each app and call a winner for your pattern.
