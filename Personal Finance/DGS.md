Great questions. Two key ideas:

## 1) “Why care about FX if I’m just parking money?”

Because your **life is in EUR**. Even if you don’t trade, the day you **spend** or **move to TR** you’ll convert back to EUR. If **EUR/USD moves**, your _EUR value_ changes:

- Suppose your USD flexible fund pays **~3% APY**. If the **euro strengthens 3% vs the dollar** over that period, your **EUR value falls ~3%**, largely wiping the extra yield vs a EUR account. That FX swing is _not_ covered by any protection scheme—it’s normal market risk (central banks and the ECB note that exchange-rate moves directly change the **valuation** of foreign-currency assets). ([European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2739~7644717754.en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Foreign currency exposure and the financial channel of ..."))
    

Also, your current USD “park” is a **money-market fund (MMF)** product at Revolut (Flexible Cash Funds). MMFs aim for stability but **can fluctuate slightly** and, in stress, EU MMFs **may impose liquidity fees/gates** or switch from constant to variable NAV. Rare, but allowed under EU rules. ([Financial Stability Board](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P270224.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Thematic Review on Money Market Fund Reforms"))

## 2) “Why is DGS so important if Revolut ‘ensures’ up to €22k?”

Because **they’re different protections** for **different things**:

- **DGS (Deposit Guarantee Scheme)** – EU-wide rule: **€100,000 per person, per bank**. It covers **bank deposits** (current/savings) if the bank fails—**principal guaranteed** up to the limit. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
    
- **€22,000 “Liabilities to Investors” insurance** – this applies to **investment accounts** at **Revolut Securities Europe UAB** (which includes **Flexible Cash Funds/MMFs**). It covers the firm’s **failure to return your assets** (insolvency/fraud), **not market losses**; Revolut states **“investment risk is excluded”**. Limit **€22,000**. **It is not a deposit guarantee.** ([Revolut](https://cdn.revolut.com/terms_and_conditions/pdf/key_information_on_the_liabilities_to_investors_insurance_scheme_60a1fe00_2.0.0_1712050063_en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Key information on the Liabilities to Investors Insurance Scheme"))
    

Revolut’s **EUR Instant Access Savings / current account** are **bank deposits with Revolut Bank UAB** and _do_ have **€100k DGS cover**. By contrast, the **USD Flexible Cash Funds** sit under the **€22k investor scheme** (no DGS, plus FX risk). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-LT/help/app-features/savings-vaults/understanding-savings-vaults-products/how-are-the-funds-in-my-savings-vaults-protected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How are the funds in my Instant Access Savings protected?"))

## Practical rule for you

- If you want the **higher APY and accept USD/FX & MMF risk** while you’re **well below €22k**, **keeping the USD Flexible balance at Revolut is reasonable** for now—just remember it’s an investment, not a deposit. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-EE/flexible-cash-funds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Maximise your Funds | Grow your Money Online"))
    
- If you want **maximum safety in EUR** (and to match future TR investing currency), **move to a DGS-insured EUR deposit** (Revolut Instant Access EUR **or** TR cash interest). That removes FX risk and gives the **€100k** guarantee on deposits. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
    

### Simple way to decide

- **Parked money you might need in EUR (or soon invest via TR):** keep it **EUR & DGS-insured**.
    
- **Yield-chasing “stash” you’re comfortable holding in USD:** **Flexible Cash Funds** are fine below **€22k**, knowing returns can be offset by **EUR/USD moves** and the cover is **not DGS**.

If you want, tell me how much you plan to keep “parked” vs how much you’ll DCA each month, and I’ll suggest an exact split (e.g., **€X** in Revolut Instant Access EUR vs **$Y** in Flexible, and **€Z** staged in TR cash) with the protections each piece has.
