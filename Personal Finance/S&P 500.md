Go with an **accumulating, Ireland-domiciled UCITS** you can put on a **free savings plan** in Trade Republic. Two great, near-identical choices:

1. **iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (Acc)** — **ISIN: IE00B5BMR087**
    
    - TER **0.07%**; huge fund; full physical replication.
        
    - In TR, search the ISIN and pick the **EUR trading line** (often shown as **SXR8** on Xetra) so you avoid extra FX at trade time. You still have USD exposure via the underlying. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B5BMR087&utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (Acc) | A0YEDG"))
        
2. **Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (Acc)** — **ISIN: IE00BFMXXD54** (tickers VUAG/VUAA)
    
    - TER **0.07%**; also large and liquid; full replication.
        
    - Same setup: use the EUR-listed line in TR and put it on a savings plan. ([justETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFMXXD54&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating"))
        

### Why these

- **Accumulating (Acc)** = dividends auto-reinvest (cleaner for long-term compounding while you’re a student/moving countries).
    
- **UCITS Ireland** = tax-efficient for EU/UK residents and PRIIPs-compliant.
    
- **TR savings plan** buys are **€0** (single ad-hoc orders are €1), perfect for DCA. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-fr/about?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds, crypto, ETFs & derivatives"))
    

### If you prefer cash dividends

- **Vanguard VUSA** (ISIN **IE00B3XXRP09**) or **iShares IUSA** (ISIN **IE0031442068**) are the distributing versions. (I still recommend Acc for your 10-year plan.)
    

**Set-up tip:** In TR → Search → paste the **ISIN** → **Create savings plan** → choose monthly date/amount (e.g., €200+) → confirm. Done. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-fr/about?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds, crypto, ETFs & derivatives"))

___

Go with **iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS (Acc)** — **ISIN IE00B5BMR087** (often **SXR8** on Xetra) as your default.

### Why iShares (CSPX/SXR8) edges it

- **Liquidity & spreads:** CSPX/SXR8 is one of the **largest and most traded** S&P 500 UCITS funds in Europe, so **spreads are typically a touch tighter**. That matters on every buy/sell—even in savings plans.
    
- **Track record:** CSPX launched **earlier** than Vanguard’s accumulating class, so it has a **longer live history** with consistently tiny tracking error.
    
- **Same costs/tax:** Both iShares (CSPX) and Vanguard (VUAA/VUAG) are **Ireland-domiciled UCITS**, **TER 0.07%**, physical replication, and the **same 15% U.S. dividend WHT** at fund level. No structural tax advantage either way.
    
- **TR savings plan:** Both typically work, but CSPX/SXR8’s depth on **Xetra** tends to pair nicely with TR’s routing.
    

### When Vanguard (VUAA/VUAG) is just as good

- If, on **your TR listing**, **VUAA** shows **equal or better spread** at the time your savings plan executes, or you simply prefer Vanguard’s lineup—pick it. Over 10 years, performance should be **near-identical**.
    

### Set-up tip

In TR, search the **ISIN** (IE00B5BMR087), choose the **EUR trading line** (e.g., **SXR8**), and create a **savings plan** (buys at **€0**). Keep using the accumulating share class.

> Reminder for later: whichever you pick, it’s a **UCITS fund**—you’ll likely want to **sell before becoming a U.S. tax resident** to avoid PFIC issues down the road.
