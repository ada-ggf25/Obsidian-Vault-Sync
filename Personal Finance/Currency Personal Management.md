Great question. Short answer: **at Trade Republic your cash is in EUR**, but you can **buy USD-denominated assets** (US stocks, UCITS ETFs tracking US markets). TR **auto-converts** at execution; there’s **no separate USD cash balance** to park there. ([BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/trade-republic-review/trade-republic-minimum-deposit?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic minimum deposit: a guide to funding your ..."))

## How TR handles currencies

- **Base / cash currency:** **EUR only** (SEPA EUR deposits/withdrawals). ([BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/trade-republic-review/trade-republic-minimum-deposit?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic minimum deposit: a guide to funding your ..."))
    
- **Buying US stocks/ETFs:** TR converts **EUR⇄USD automatically** when the order settles; you pay the **€1 trade fee** (savings-plan buys are €0) plus any **FX spread/margin** embedded in the conversion. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-lt/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    
- **Dividends in USD:** TR converts them to **EUR** on receipt (a small FX margin may apply). ([Curvo](https://curvo.eu/article/trade-republic-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic review: read this before you start"))
    

> Important nuance: the **trading/listing currency ≠ currency exposure**.  
> Example: **iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS (CSPX/SXR8)** trades in **EUR** on Xetra, but the **share-class/base currency is USD** and the holdings are US stocks → you still carry **USD exposure** even if you buy the **EUR-traded** line.

## “Invest along USD & EUR” — simple ways to do it at TR

Since you like the idea of aligning with global reserve heavyweights (USD+EUR), here are two clean approaches:

### A) Keep it ultra-simple (no extra tickers)

- **EUR exposure** = your **EUR cash** (Revolut Instant Access Savings or TR cash interest ~2% p.a.; both DGS-insured up to €100k).
    
- **USD exposure** = your **US equity UCITS** (e.g., S&P 500 UCITS accumulator on TR).  
    This already splits you between **EUR cash** and **USD-exposed equities** with minimal moving parts. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    

### B) Add explicit EUR equities (if you want EUR equity beta too)

- Keep the S&P 500 UCITS as your **USD leg**.
    
- Add a **Europe/Eurozone UCITS** (e.g., MSCI Europe or EURO STOXX 50) as your **EUR equity leg**.  
    Both can be set up as **TR savings plans** (buys at **€0**; sells **€1**). ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-ie?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    

## How much USD vs EUR?

Official reserves still skew **USD-heavy** with the **euro second** (latest IMF COFER/Reuters: ≈ **57–58% USD**, **~20% EUR**). You don’t need to copy those exactly, but they’re a reasonable compass if that’s your thesis. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/percent-global-fx-reserves-dollars-ticks-up-amounts-fall-imf-data-shows-2025-03-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Percent of global FX reserves in dollars ticks up, amounts fall, IMF data shows"))

## Concrete, low-friction setup for you (fits your 10-year plan)

1. **Keep EUR cash where you prefer safety:** Revolut **Instant Access (EUR)** or **TR cash interest**. Both are **deposit-insured**; pick the better rate. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    
2. **On TR, set savings plans** (fee-free buys):
    
    - **USD leg:** S&P 500 **UCITS** accumulator (e.g., CSPX/SXR8 share class).
        
    - **(Optional) EUR leg:** MSCI Europe / EURO STOXX 50 **UCITS**.
        
    - **Gold:** a **physically-backed EUR-traded ETC** (e.g., JE00B588CD74 / IE00B4ND3602).
        
    - **Crypto:** if you’re fine **without on-chain withdrawals**, TR is cheap (manual trades **€1**; crypto savings plans supported). ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-lt/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
        
3. **Remember:** even when you buy the **EUR-listed** line of a US UCITS, you’re still **USD-exposed** via the underlying. That’s how you “own USD” at TR without holding USD cash. ([BlackRock](https://www.ishares.com/de/individual/de/literature/fact-sheet/cspx-ishares-core-s-p-500-ucits-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-de.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF"))
    

If you want, tell me the **percentage split** you’d like (e.g., 60% USD equity / 25% EUR equity / 10% gold / 5% crypto, with €X parked in EUR cash). I’ll map that to **specific UCITS tickers** on TR and a **monthly savings-plan schedule** that keeps fees at (or near) **€0** to buy.
