Great add! **Trading 212 (T212)** is a very solid fit for a long-term, buy-and-hold setup‚Äîespecially for **stocks/ETFs** and **idle EUR cash**. Here‚Äôs how it stacks up next to **Trade Republic (TR)** and **Revolut** for your use case (free plans).

# Quick take

- **Stocks & ETFs:** T212 is **commission-free**; you only pay **0.15% FX** when the stock/ETF is in another currency. For **EUR-listed UCITS ETFs**, that‚Äôs effectively **‚Ç¨0** per trade. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading 212: Commission-free investing for everyone"))
    
- **Gold:** Buy a **physically-backed gold ETF/ETC** on T212 with **‚Ç¨0 commission** (FX 0.15% if not EUR). TR costs **‚Ç¨1/order**; both are fine, but T212 is often cheaper if you pick an **EUR-traded** gold product. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
    
- **Crypto:** **No spot crypto** on T212 Invest; limited/CFD or ETN availability depends on entity, so it‚Äôs **not** your crypto venue. Prefer **TR** (flat **‚Ç¨1/trade**) or **Revolut** if you need **on-chain withdrawals**. ([Trading 212 Community](https://community.trading212.com/t/bitcoin-etf-uk-eu/85625?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Bitcoin ETF UK/EU - üì¨ Stocks & ETFs requests"))
    
- **Idle EUR cash (APY/AER):** T212 pays **~2.20% AER on EUR**, **paid daily**; TR pays **~2.00%** (wording varies by country page). Revolut varies by plan. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))

### Handy cost rules (your DCA style)

- **Foreign-currency trades:** T212‚Äôs **0.15% FX** equals TR‚Äôs **‚Ç¨1** at **~‚Ç¨667 per order**.
    
    - **< ‚Ç¨667** ‚Üí T212 cheaper; **> ‚Ç¨667** ‚Üí TR‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1 cheaper.
        
    - **EUR-listed** ETFs/stocks on T212 ‚Üí usually **‚Ç¨0**. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
        
- **ETF savings plans:** TR executes at **‚Ç¨0**; T212 AutoInvest is also **commission-free**, but you still pay **0.15% FX** if the ETF trades in another currency. Prefer **EUR-listed UCITS ETFs** on T212 to avoid FX. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-lt/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    

### Extra T212 perks (nice-to-haves)

- **Interest on cash** (EUR ~2.20% AER), **paid daily**; you can see where cash is parked (banks/QMMFs) in-app. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- Optional **Share Lending** to earn a bit on lendable shares (collateralised; can be disabled). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/share-lending?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Earn daily interest with share lending"))

## Suggested setup for you (buy-and-hold, free tiers)

- **Core ETFs & most stocks:** **T212**, prioritising **EUR-listed UCITS** (zero commission, no FX). Use **Pies/AutoInvest** for monthly DCA. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/auto-invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Pies & AutoInvest: Building wealth is a habit"))
    
- **Big single USD stock buys (>~‚Ç¨700):** place on **Trade Republic** (flat **‚Ç¨1** likely beats T212‚Äôs 0.15%). ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018909758-What-is-the-FX-fee-Invest-Stocks-ISA?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is the FX fee? (Invest & Stocks ISA)"))
    
- **Gold:** either app via a large **EUR-traded physical gold ETC**; T212 often edges on cost if EUR-listed. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-lt/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    
- **Crypto:** keep on **Trade Republic** (cheap ‚Ç¨1/order) **or** **Revolut** if you specifically need **on-chain withdrawals**. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/crypto/tiered-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Tiered Pricing | Revolut United Kingdom"))
    
- **Cash park:** **T212** for the slightly higher **EUR AER (~2.20%)** vs TR‚Äôs ~2.00%. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    

If you share your **typical order sizes** (e.g., ‚Äú‚Ç¨300/mo ETF, ‚Ç¨1,000 quarterly US stock, ‚Ç¨100/mo crypto‚Äù), I‚Äôll crunch exact annual ‚Ç¨ fees across T212/TR/Revolut and point to the cheapest combo for your pattern.

Got it‚Äîthanks for the extra context. Given your goals (10-year buy-and-hold across UCITS ETFs tracking the US, a few US stocks, gold, some crypto, and a safe place to park cash with minimal friction/fees), here‚Äôs the call and the plan.

# The call (short version)

- **Primary broker for investing: Trade Republic (TR)** ‚Äî because **savings plans on stocks/ETFs/crypto have ‚Ç¨0 buy fee**, and that fits your long-term DCA style. Single trades are a flat **‚Ç¨1**; cash earns **~2% p.a.**; deposits by **SEPA bank transfer are free**. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))
    
- **Cash hub: Revolut Instant Access Savings (EUR)** for emergency/parked cash ‚Äî **DGS-insured to ‚Ç¨100k**. Keep the **USD flexible fund** only if you like the yield and don‚Äôt need DGS on that portion. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-ES/legal/savings-how-does-it-work/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings - How does it work"))
    
- **Keep a Trading 212 (T212) account** as a tactical option (no subscription). It‚Äôs **commission-free**, but you pay a **0.15% FX** when converting to/from USD. It‚Äôs handy for **one-off, small US stock buys** where TR‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1 might be more than 0.15% of your order, and for its **AutoInvest ‚ÄúPies.‚Äù** Note: T212‚Äôs higher cash interest often comes from **QMMFs (not deposit-insured)**. ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))

## Why this fits your constraints

### Safety (what happens in a worst case)

- **Revolut Instant Access Savings (EUR)**: deposits are covered by the **EU DGS to ‚Ç¨100,000** via Revolut Bank UAB. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-LT/legal/deposit-insurance-information/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit Insurance Information | Revolut Lithuania"))
    
- **Securities at TR/T212**: your **stocks/ETFs/gold ETCs are segregated** and remain your property. If a broker failed and assets weren‚Äôt returned, EU **investor-compensation schemes typically cover 90% up to ‚Ç¨20,000** for unrecovered assets; **cash at partner banks is covered up to ‚Ç¨100,000** under national DGS (e.g., Germany for TR). ([BaFin](https://www.bafin.de/EN/Verbraucher/Bank/Einlagensicherung/einlagensicherung_node_en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Deposit guarantee and investor compensation schemes"))
    
- **T212 cash interest**: often placed partly in **qualifying money market funds (QMMFs)**; low risk, but **not deposit-insured**. If you don‚Äôt opt-in, cash sits in banks only. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/15475153380637-What-is-interest-on-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is interest on cash?"))
    
- **TR crypto**: **no on-chain withdrawals** (you must sell to cash out). If self-custody matters, keep crypto DCA small at TR or use a venue that supports withdrawals (Revolut does for select coins, but fees are higher; a dedicated exchange is another option). ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-gr/449-Can-I-cash-out-my-crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Can I cash out my crypto?"))
    

### Fees & friction (what you‚Äôll actually pay)

- **TR savings plans** (stocks/ETFs/crypto): **‚Ç¨0 to buy**; **selling ‚Ç¨1**. Perfect for monthly/biweekly buys. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))
    
- **TR single trades**: **‚Ç¨1** per order.
    
- **T212 trades**: **‚Ç¨0 commission**; **0.15% FX when converting** (can hold multi-currency and convert once). ([Trading 212](https://www.trading212.com/terms/invest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trading terms for Invest accounts"))
    
- **Break-even** for ad-hoc US stock buys (not via plan):
    
    - TR: ‚Ç¨1 vs. T212: 0.15% √ó order size ‚Üí **T212 cheaper below ~‚Ç¨667**, TR cheaper above that.
        
- **Funding**: **SEPA bank transfers** to TR/T212 are **free**; **card top-ups** can carry a **fee (often ~0.7‚Äì1%)**‚Äîso just use SEPA to avoid the ‚Ç¨3 you saw on ‚Ç¨300. ([BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/trade-republic-review/trade-republic-fees?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic Fees Explained"))
    

### Product availability (important for your ‚ÄúUS ETFs‚Äù goal)

- As an EU retail investor, you **can‚Äôt buy US-domiciled ETFs** (PRIIPs KID rule). Use **UCITS equivalents** (e.g., S&P 500/Total World UCITS) at TR/T212. ([European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2021-004745_EN.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Restricted access to US ETFs for ordinary EU retail investors"))

## Action plan (do this now)

1. **Keep Revolut as your cash base**
    
    - Park emergency/short-term cash in **EUR Instant Access Savings** (DGS-insured to ‚Ç¨100k). ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-ES/legal/savings-how-does-it-work/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings - How does it work"))
        
    - If that **USD 756** at 2.98% is truly ‚Äúparked,‚Äù leave it; if you intend to invest soon, convert to **EUR on a weekday** and **SEPA** it to TR to avoid top-up fees. (SEPA is free; USD SWIFT transfers are typically not worth it.) ([Trading 212 Community](https://community.trading212.com/t/transfering-the-portfolio-to-uk-trading212-currency-question/66980?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Transfering the portfolio to UK - trading212 currency question"))
        
2. **Set up TR as your main investing rail**
    
    - **Fund by SEPA** (free). ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-lt/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic: Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
        
    - Create **3 savings plans** (monthly or twice-monthly):
        
        - **UCITS S&P 500 or MSCI World** (accumulating) ‚Äî core equity.
            
        - **Gold ETC** (physically-backed, EUR-listed).
            
        - **Crypto** (e.g., BTC/ETH) ‚Äî only if you‚Äôre fine **without self-custody**. **Buys are ‚Ç¨0** on plans. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/pl-pl/768-How-can-I-create-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can I create a savings plan?"))
            
    - When you need to **sell** after years, budget **‚Ç¨1 per sale** on TR. ([support.traderepublic.com](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ie/778-What-are-the-costs-of-a-savings-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the costs of a savings plan?"))
        
3. **Keep T212 for edge cases**
    
    - Use **T212** when you want a **one-off, small (<‚Ç¨667) US stock buy** at a specific time (0.15% FX can be less than TR‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1) or if you like **AutoInvest ‚ÄúPies.‚Äù** ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009510317-How-does-AutoInvest-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How does AutoInvest work?"))
        
    - Remember: T212‚Äôs **cash interest** may involve **QMMFs** (not DGS) ‚Äî fine for short holding, but don‚Äôt store large emergency cash there. ([Trading 212](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/15475153380637-What-is-interest-on-cash?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is interest on cash?"))
        
4. **Small optimisations**
    
    - If you later want **crypto self-custody**, don‚Äôt use TR for that piece; Revolut supports **on-chain withdrawals** for some coins (fees apply), or use a dedicated exchange. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/transferring-cryptocurrencies/withdrawing-cryptocurrencies/how-do-i-send-crypto-to-an-external-wallet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Send (withdraw) crypto to an external address"))
        
    - If you think you might **move brokers** one day, note that **transfer-out fees from TR** are debated; the price list in-app governs and third-party costs may apply. It‚Äôs usually inexpensive, but verify in the app before building a very fragmented portfolio. ([Trade Republic](https://assets.traderepublic.com/assets/files/CA_PT-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Customer Agreement"))

## Bottom line for your situation

You‚Äôre already comfortable with Revolut and want minimal hassle and fees. **TR as your main DCA platform + Revolut for insured savings** gives you **low ongoing costs, automation, and strong protection**. Keep **T212** as a **backup tool** for occasional small, time-specific US stock buys and for its Pies‚Äîuseful, but not necessary as your core.

If you want, tell me your exact monthly amounts for each bucket (ETF / gold / crypto / cash), and I‚Äôll lay out specific TR savings plans (tickers/ISINs + cadence) that match this plan.
