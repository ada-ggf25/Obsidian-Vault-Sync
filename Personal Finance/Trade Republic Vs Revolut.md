[[Trade Republic Vs Revolut - Derivatives]]
[[Trade Republic Vs Revolut - Account with APY]]

Got it—**buy & hold** on the **free plans** only. Here’s the clean, low-effort setup across **stocks, ETFs, gold, crypto, and idle cash**.

## The simple split

|Asset|Best app (free plan)|Why (short)|
|---|---|---|
|**ETFs**|**Trade Republic**|**€0** to execute **ETF savings plans**; otherwise **€1/order**. Perfect for monthly DCA. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))|
|**Stocks**|**Trade Republic**|**€1/order** beats Revolut after your small monthly allowance; predictable for buy/sell a few times a year. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/support?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic help center"))|
|**Gold**|**Trade Republic** (buy a **physically-backed gold ETC/ETF**)|You pay **€1/order** + the fund’s low TER (often ~0.15%). Revolut’s gold “exposure” costs **0.99% per buy/sell** on Standard (+ min fee). ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))|
|**Crypto**|**It depends** → **TR** if you just buy/hold; **Revolut** if you need **on-chain withdrawals**|TR: **€1/trade**; no crypto transfers. Revolut: **tiered % fee** (Standard starts **1.49%** ≤€10k/30d) **and minimums**, but supports withdrawals for some coins/networks. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))|
|**Idle EUR cash (APY)**|**Trade Republic**|**~2% p.a.** on cash, accrued daily, paid monthly, no lock-in. Revolut’s AER on Standard varies by market/promos—check in-app. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-es/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))|

### Notes for Revolut (since you’re on **Standard**)

- **Stocks/ETFs:** typically **1 commission-free trade/month**, then **0.25%/trade (min €1)**; custody fee was **removed in 2024**. If you rarely trade and keep inside that 1 free/month, Revolut can be fine. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/our-pricing-plans/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Compare Revolut Plans | Revolut United Kingdom"))
    
- **Gold:** **0.99% per buy/sell (min €1)**; plus fair-usage FX limits can add **+1%** if you exceed the monthly exchange cap. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/precious-metals/getting-started-with-precious-metals/how-much-does-precious-metals-exposure-cost-and-how-is-it-calculated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Commodities prices, rates, and fees"))
    
- **Crypto:** **tiered 1.49% → 0.49%** by 30-day volume on Standard, **or a minimum fee** for small tickets—whichever is **higher**. Supports withdrawals on specific tokens/networks only. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-IE/crypto/tiered-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Tiered Pricing"))

## Quick cost rules (helpful for DCA)

- **Stocks/ETFs:** Revolut’s **0.25% = €1** at **€400**. For trades **> €400**, TR’s flat **€1** is cheaper; for **≤ €400**, Revolut (outside the free trade) can be equal/cheaper—**but ETF savings plans on TR are €0**, so TR usually wins for monthly DCA. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-PT/news/revolut_adds_european_listed_stocks_to_its_trading_platform_across_the_eea/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Revolut adds European listed stocks to its trading platform ..."))
    
- **Crypto:** On Standard, **1.49% = €1** at ~**€67**. Above ~€100, **TR’s €1** is typically cheaper—unless you need **self-custody**, in which case use Revolut (or a dedicated exchange). Mind Revolut’s **minimum fees** on small buys. ([Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/en-IE/crypto/tiered-pricing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Crypto Tiered Pricing"))
    
- **Gold:** **TR gold ETC @ €1/order** usually beats **Revolut 0.99% each side** on anything but very tiny orders. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/precious-metals/getting-started-with-precious-metals/how-much-does-precious-metals-exposure-cost-and-how-is-it-calculated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Commodities prices, rates, and fees"))

## Taxes (Portugal, high-level)

- **Interest & dividends:** **28%** withholding/flat rate. ([PwC](https://www.pwc.pt/en/pwcinforfisco/tax-guide/2025/pit.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "2025 Tax Guide – PIT"))
    
- **Capital gains (shares/ETFs):** generally **28%** flat (with option to aggregate). ([Sumários Fiscais PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/portugal/individual/income-determination?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Individual - Income determination - Portugal"))
    
- **Crypto:** since 2023, gains on coins **held < 365 days** taxed **28%**; **≥ 365 days** typically **exempt** (other crypto activities may differ). Keep holding-period records. ([Sumários Fiscais PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/portugal/individual/other-issues?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Individual - Other issues - Portugal"))

## My recommendation for your long plan (no paid tiers)

1. **Make TR your core:**
    
    - Set up **ETF savings plans (€0 execution)** for your main equity exposure.
        
    - Hold **idle cash** there to earn ~**2% p.a.** while you wait. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
        
2. **Gold:** buy a **large, physically-backed gold ETC/ETF** on TR (e.g., WisdomTree Physical Swiss Gold) when you rebalance; cost = **€1/trade**. ([traderepublic.com](https://traderepublic.com/en-gr/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Invest in stocks, bonds & ETFs"))
    
3. **Crypto:**
    
    - If you **don’t** need on-chain moves → **buy/hold on TR** for **€1/trade**.
        
    - If you **do** need withdrawals → use **Revolut** (check token/network support), or consider a dedicated exchange plus self-custody. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/1489-What-are-the-fees-for-trading-Crypto?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What are the fees for trading crypto?"))
        
4. **Revolut:** keep for **banking/spending** and the **occasional** free stock/ETF trade; avoid using it for gold (fees). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/precious-metals/getting-started-with-precious-metals/how-much-does-precious-metals-exposure-cost-and-how-is-it-calculated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Commodities prices, rates, and fees"))
    

If you want, tell me your **typical ticket sizes** (e.g., “€300/month ETF, €100/month crypto”) and I’ll compute your **annual € costs** on each app and the exact break-even points for your pattern.

Short answer: **yes—keeping the USD “Flexible Cash Funds” at Revolut is reasonable _for now_** if (a) you’re still **well below €22k** there, (b) you accept **USD/EUR FX risk**, and (c) you value the **higher APY** over deposit-guarantee protection. When you get closer to (or above) **€22k**, start **diversifying** new cash into **EUR, DGS-insured** places (Revolut Instant Access EUR or TR cash) and into your TR investments.

Here’s the logic, tied to facts:

- **What you hold at Revolut today**: your 2.98% is in **Flexible Cash Funds (MMFs)**—an _investment_, not a deposit. Protection is via **Lithuania’s Liabilities to Investors scheme up to €22k**, not a bank deposit guarantee; and the NAV and **USD/EUR** FX can move. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-MT/help/app-features/flexible-accounts/getting-started-with-in-flexibleaccountsname-flexible-accounts-in-flexibleaccountsname-in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Getting started with Flexible Cash Funds"))
    
- **TR cash “APY”**: TR pays about **2% p.a.** on **EUR cash**; that cash sits at partner **EU banks** with **€100k DGS** per bank. Lower yield than your USD MMF, but stronger protection. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de/interest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interest on your cash, unlimited."))
    
- **Funding TR**: TR is **EUR-only**. You **SEPA EUR** in (no USD balance to park). Dividends in USD are **auto-converted to EUR**. So eventually, USD at Revolut must be **converted to EUR** to invest at TR. Avoid **weekend** FX because Revolut adds about **1%** markup then. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-lu/2678-How-do-I-transfer-money-to-my-Trade-Republic-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I transfer money to my Trade Republic account?"))
    
- **Your USD/EUR exposure idea**: you can still “own USD” at TR by buying **UCITS ETFs tracking US markets**—even if you trade the **EUR-listed** line, your economic exposure is to USD assets. (E.g., CSPX/SXR8 are the same S&P 500 UCITS fund with different trading currencies.) ([BlackRock](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund?utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF | CSPX"))
    
- **Reserve-style split**: If you like aligning to reserves, the **USD share ~57–58%** and **EUR ~20%** recently—use that as a compass for your equity/cash mix, not as a rule. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/percent-global-fx-reserves-dollars-ticks-up-amounts-fall-imf-data-shows-2025-03-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Percent of global FX reserves in dollars ticks up, amounts fall, IMF data shows"))
    

## What I’d do (simple rules you can run for 10 years)

**1) Keep the USD Flexible fund at Revolut _until you’re near €22k_.**  
You’re getting the higher APY. Below ~€22k, the investor-insurance cap isn’t binding; just remember it’s **not DGS** and FX can swing. If USD weakens vs EUR by ~1%, that can wipe ~1% of extra yield—so don’t treat the APY premium as “free.” ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/accounts/difference-between-instant-access-savings-and-flexible-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings vs Flexible Cash Funds"))

**2) All new _EUR_ cash you want very safe → DGS deposits.**  
Park in **Revolut Instant Access (EUR)** or **TR cash** for **€100k DGS** protection. Pick whichever shows the better current rate; both are easy to move from when you invest. ([Trade Republic Support](https://support.traderepublic.com/en-ee/743-How-is-my-money-protected?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How is my money protected?"))

**3) Invest through Trade Republic (low fees, automated).**

- Use **Savings Plans (fee-free buys)** for your **UCITS US equity**, **gold ETC**, and **crypto** (manual crypto trades are €1; plans to buy are free). You only pay **€1 when you sell** later. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic. Invest, spend and bank."))
    
- Since TR is **EUR-only**, convert **USD→EUR in Revolut on weekdays** and **SEPA** it in batches (no card top-ups). ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    

**4) Keep your USD/EUR theme without holding USD at TR.**  
Let **USD exposure** come from the **US UCITS ETF**; let **EUR exposure** come from your **EUR cash** and, if you want, a **Eurozone/Europe UCITS** sleeve. This mirrors your “international reserve” idea with minimal friction. ([BlackRock](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/253743/ishares-sp-500-b-ucits-etf-acc-fund?utm_source=chatgpt.com "iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF | CSPX"))

## Concrete actions (right now)

- **Leave current USD Flexible balance at Revolut** (below €22k) for the higher APY. Know it’s an MMF (investment) with **€22k investor insurance**, not DGS. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-ES/help/accounts/difference-between-instant-access-savings-and-flexible-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Instant Access Savings vs Flexible Cash Funds"))
    
- **Set up TR savings plans** (monthly):
    
    - **US equities (UCITS S&P 500 or Total Market)**
        
    - **Gold** (physically-backed **EUR-traded** ETC)
        
    - **Crypto** (if you’re fine without on-chain withdrawals) — plans buy at **€0**. ([Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com/en-de?openModal=pricing-scheme&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Trade Republic. Invest, spend and bank."))
        
- When you want to fund TR: **convert USD→EUR on a weekday** in Revolut → **SEPA EUR** to TR. ([Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/en-US/help/wealth/exchanging-money/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-exchange/will-i-be-charged-for-exchanging-foreign-currencies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Currency exchange fees and limits"))
    
- As your Revolut Flexible USD approaches **€22k**, start **redirecting new money** to **EUR DGS deposits** (Revolut Instant EUR or TR cash) and/or **into TR investments**.
    

If you’d like, tell me your target split (e.g., **60% US equity, 20% EUR equity, 10% gold, 10% crypto**, plus how much you want to keep in “yield cash”), and I’ll map that to **specific UCITS tickers** at TR and a **savings-plan schedule** that keeps your buy fees at (or near) **€0**.
