Short answer: **make Trade Republic your primary**, and use **Trading 212 tactically** for small US-stock buys.

## The rule of thumb

- **UCITS ETFs (e.g., S&P 500)** → **Trade Republic** via **savings plans**: **€0 buy fee** and dead simple automation.
    
- **Individual US stocks**
    
    - **Order < ~€667** → **T212** is cheaper (0.15% FX ≈ €0.45 on €300 vs €1 at TR).
        
    - **Order ≥ ~€667** → **TR** is cheaper (flat **€1** beats T212’s % FX; e.g., €1,000 costs €1 at TR vs ~€1.50 FX at T212).
        

## What I’d do for you

- **Primary:** Set up your monthly DCA in **TR** (S&P 500 UCITS + gold + any crypto) — free to buy, €1 only when you sell years from now.
    
- **Stocks:** If you’re adding **€500-ish** to AAPL/NVDA/META/PLTR/TSMC, place those **in T212**; when you do **€1,000+** tickets, place them **in TR**.
    
- **If you prefer one app only:** Stick to **TR**. The cost difference on sub-€667 orders is tiny (e.g., €0.45 vs €1), and keeping everything in one place + automated plans can be worth that convenience.
    

If you tell me your typical **per-trade size** and how often you’ll buy each stock, I’ll map every order to TR or T212 and give you the exact annual € cost for both approaches (single-app vs split).

Great Q — here’s the “why” in plain terms.

## 1) Total cost (your ticket sizes)

- **TR = flat €1/order.**
    
- **T212 = 0.15% FX** whenever you buy/sell USD stocks (no commission).
    
- **Break-even:** €1 ÷ 0.0015 ≈ **€667**.
    
    - **< €667** → T212 cheaper (e.g., €500 order → €0.75 vs €1).
        
    - **≥ €667** → TR cheaper (e.g., €1,000 order → **€1** vs **€1.50**).
        

For **UCITS ETFs** you’ll DCA monthly, **TR savings plans buy at €0**, which beats everything.

## 2) Automation & simplicity

- **TR savings plans** cover **ETFs, many stocks, and even crypto** with **€0 buy fee**. That’s perfect for a 10-year, set-and-forget DCA.
    
- T212’s **AutoInvest/Pies** are good, but you still pay **0.15% FX** for USD stocks.
    

## 3) Cash yield & safety while you wait

- **TR** pays around **~2% on idle EUR** and keeps cash under **€100k deposit protection** (when held at partner banks). That’s a nice parking spot between buys.
    
- T212 may pay slightly more but part can sit in **money-market funds (not deposit-insured)** — fine, just a different risk wrapper.
    

## 4) Friction (funding & currency)

- You fund **both** via **free SEPA**.
    
- Your life is EUR→GBP for living and **USD exposure via US stocks/UCITS** for growth. **TR** (EUR-only account) + **EUR-listed UCITS** keeps flows clean; for **direct USD stocks**, the cost rule above tells you when T212’s 0.15% wins.
    

## 5) Portfolio fit

- **Core:** S&P 500 UCITS (EUR-listed) → **TR savings plan (€0)**.
    
- **Satellites:** Tech names (AAPL/NVDA/etc.). When you’re adding **€500ish**, **T212** is usually a bit cheaper; when you place **€1k blocks**, **TR** wins.
    
- **Crypto:** If you DCA a little, **TR** is **€1/trade** (or €0 via plan) — cheaper than Revolut’s % fees (and fine if you don’t need on-chain withdrawals).
    

## 6) One-app vs two-app reality

- If you **want one app only**, pick **TR**: you’ll pay at most an extra **€0.25–€0.55** on sub-€667 stock orders versus T212, but you gain **full automation + €0 ETF buys** and simple cash handling.
    
- If you **don’t mind two apps**, use **T212** only for the occasional **small USD stock** buy where it’s strictly cheaper.
    

**That’s it:** TR as the primary gives you **€0 ETF DCA**, **€1 caps on ad-hoc trades**, safe cash parking, and low friction; T212 is the scalpel for **small USD stock** orders where the 0.15% FX beats €1.
